AUTHOR'S FOREWORD


The history now being prepared seems necessary; for we are at a period
of great flux and change and progress. The city is being transformed,
modernized and enlarged before our very eyes. Old landmarks are daily
disappearing and there is a danger of numerous memories of the past
passing with them.

We are growing so wonderfully in wealth through the importance of
our commerce and in the size of our population by the accretion of
newcomers of many national origins and creeds, to whom for the most
part the history of the romantic story of Montreal is a sealed books,
that a fuller presentation of our development and growth is called for,
to supplement previous sketches and to meet the conditions of the hour.

It is hardly needful, therefore, to offer any apology for the
present undertaking. For if the continuity of a city's growth and
development is to be preserved in the memory of the citizens of each
generation, this can only be done through the medium of an historical
survey, issued at certain suitable intervals, such as the one now
offered, connecting the present with the past, and presenting to the
new generation, out of the intricate chain of events and varying
vicissitudes that have woven themselves into the texture of the city's
organic life, the story of those forces which have moulded its growth
and have produced those resultant characteristic features which make it
the individualized city of today and none other.

Montreal being a unique city, with a personality of its own, its
history, beyond that of any city of the new world, is particularly
interesting and fruitful for such a retrospect. Dealing with the
fortunes of several peoples, the original inhabitants of Hochelaga
visited by Jacques Cartier in 1535, the French colonists from 1642 and
the Anglo-Saxons and Gaels from their influx in 1760, together with the
steady addition of those of other national origins of later years, the
story of Montreal, passing over the greater part of four centuries, is
full of romance and colour and quickly moving incidents; of compelling
interest to the ordinary student, but how much more so to those who
have any way leagued their fortunes with it, and assisted in its
progress and in its making!

Such cannot dip into the pages of the history of this ancient and
modern city without finding fresh motives for renewed enthusiasm and
for deeper pride.

For Montreal is still in the making, with its future before it.

The present work is especially dedicated to those who would realize the
duties of good citizenship and it is the hope of the writer that it may
serve to deepen the sense of civic pride now happily being cultivated
here. To foster this civic pride is the justifying reason why he has
been induced by his friends to launch on a long and laborious task,
sweetened though it may be by the pleasure anticipated of communion
with the scenes and thoughts and deeds of a romantic past and a
wonderfully progressive present.

All history is profitable. Perhaps, however, civic history has not
been cultivated sufficiently. The present work is an attempt to
repair this by interesting Montrealers in their citizenship so that
by placing before them the deeds of the doers of the past, they may
realize they are dwellers in no mean city. We would hope that something
of the spirit of love for their cities, of the Romans, Athenians, or
Florentines, might be reincarnated, here in Montreal. Good citizenship
would then be thoroughly understood as the outcome of a passionate love
of all that is upright, noble and uplifting in human conduct, applied
to the life of a city by which it shall be made beautiful and lovable
in the sight of God and man. For this purpose the life story of any
city that has reached any eminence and has a worthy past should be
known by good citizens so that they begin to love it with a _personal_
love.

For like each nation, each city has its own individuality, its own
characteristic entity, its own form of life which must be made the most
of by art and thoughtful love.

This is not merely true of the physical being of a city from the city
planner's point of view. There is also a specific character in the
spiritual, artistic, moral and practical life of every city that has
grown into virility and made an impress on the world.

Every such city is unique; it has its predominant virtues and failings.
You may partially eliminate the latter and enlarge the former, but the
city being human--the product of the sum total of the qualities and
defects of its inhabitants--it takes on a character, a personality, a
mentality all its own.

Civic history then leads us to delve down into the origins of things to
find out the causes and sources of that ultimate city character which
we see reflected today in such a city as Montreal.

The research is fascinating and satisfactory to the citizen who
would know his surroundings, and live in them intelligently with
consideration for the diverse view points of those of his fellow
citizens who have different national origins and divergent mental
outlooks from his own.

Yet while this city character is in a way fixed, still it is not so
stable but that it will be susceptible to further development in the
times that are to come with new problems and new situations to grapple
with.

The peculiar pleasure of the reading of the history of Montreal will be
to witness the development of its present character from the earliest
date of the small pioneering, religious settlement of French colonists,
living simple and uneventful days, but chequered by the constant fear
of the forays of Indian marauders on to the "Castle Dangerous" of Ville
Marie, through its more mature periods of city formation, then onward
through the difficult days of the fusion of the French and English
civilization starting in 1760, to the complex life of the great and
prosperous cosmopolitan city of today, the port and commercial centre
of Canada--the old and new _régimes_ making one harmonious unity, but
with its component parts easily discernible. The city's motto is aptly
chosen, "_Concordia Salus_."

Much there will be learned in the history of Montreal of the past that
will explain the present and the mentality of its people. _Tout savoir,
c'est tout pardonner._

A clue to the future will also be afforded beforehand. Certainly it
will be seen that Montreal is great and will be greater still, because
great thoughts, high ideals, strenuous purposes have been born and
fostered within its walls.

The thinking student will witness the law of cause and effect, of
action, and reaction, ever at work, and will read design where the
undisciplined mind would only see chaos and blind forces at work.

Recognizing that the city is a living organism with a personality of
its own, he will watch with ever increasing interest the life emerging
from the seed and at work in all the varying stages of its growth and
development. He will see the first rude beginning of the city, its
struggles for existence, its organized life in its social and municipal
aspects, its beginnings of art and learning, the building of its
churches, the conscious struggles of its people to realize itself, the
troubles of its household, the battle of virtue and vice, its relation
to other cities, the story of its attacks from without, the conflicts
with opposing ideas, the influx of new elements into the population,
the adaptation of the organism to new habits of government and thought,
to new methods of business, and the inauguration of untried and new
industrial enterprises, the growth of its harbour, and its internal
and external commerce, the conception of its own destiny as one of the
great cities of the world--all these and more it is the purpose of
a history of Montreal to unfold to the thoughtful citizen who would
understand the life in which he is playing his part not as a blind
factor but as an intelligent co-operator in the intricate and absorbing
game of life.

But let it not be thought that while peering into the past we shall
become blind to the present. In this "History of Montreal" we shall
picture the busy world as we see it round us. Here are heroic and
saintly deeds being done today in our midst. The foundations of new and
mighty works even surpassing those of the past are being laid in the
regions of religion, philanthropy, art, science, commerce, engineering,
government and city planning this very hour, and their builders are
unconsciously building unto fame.

Besides, therefore, portraying the past, we would wish to present
a moving picture of the continued development of Montreal from the
beginning, tracing it to the living present from the "mustard seed"
so long ago spoken of by Père Vimont in reference to the handful of
his fellow pioneers assembled at Mass on the day of the arrival on May
18, 1642, at the historic spot marked today by the monument in Place
Royale, to the _mighty_ tree of his prophecy that now has covered the
whole Island of Montreal, and by the boldness, foresight and enterprise
of Montreal's master builders, has stretched its conquering arms of
streams and iron across the mighty continent discovered by Jacques
Cartier in 1535.

What Montreal was and is, we know. Its future we can only surmise.
But it is bound to be a great one. Its position, with its mountain
in the centre and its encircling waterways, with the glorious St.
Lawrence at its feet, proclaims it as the ideal location for one of the
greatest cities in the world. It is no cause for wonder that Jacques
Cartier, visiting it in 1535, after naming the mountain "Mount Royal"
in honour of his king, Francis I of France, should have commended it
as favourable for a settlement in his description of his voyage to
Hochelaga, and that Champlain in 1611 should have made it his trading
post and further endorsed it as a suitable place for a permanent
settlement, and that Maisonneuve should have carried it into execution
in 1642. They had the instinct of the city planner--that is all.

That they did not err, the history of Montreal will abundantly show.

PREFACE

    "QUI MANET IN PATRIA ET PATRIAM COGNOSCERE TEMNIT
        IS MIHI NON CIVIS, SED PEREGRINUS ERIT"


In placing before the public the first volume of the History of
Montreal, under the title of "Under the French Régime," I would first
dedicate it to a group of prominent lovers of the city, truly deserving
the name of good citizens, who originally encouraged me to undertake
the historical researches necessary for this work in the view that
an orderly narration of the city's origins and gradual development
would thereby foster the right spirit of civic pride in those who do
not merely dwell in this ancient and new city, but have linked their
fortunes with it at least for a while.

Secondly, it is dedicated to those who endorsed the above invitation by
subscribing for copies, thus making publication possible.

Thirdly, it is dedicated to all good citizens of Montreal, whether by
birth or adoption, who will welcome this attempt to interest them in
their citizenship.

Further, it is offered to all students of the civic life and progress
of our Canadian cities through the medium of the historical method. May
it encourage a healthy Canadian civic consciousness begotten of the
records of the doings of the early makers of our Canadian cities.

May it encourage the careful keeping of early historical documents,
especially among those new municipalities now growing up in the new
Canada of today.

I wish to take this opportunity of thanking those who have especially
made my way easy in this first volume by affording me access to books
or documents. Among these are: Mr. W. D. Lighthall, president of the
Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Montreal, who was also the first
to encourage this present work, Dr. A. Doughty, Mr. C. H. Gould, of the
McGill University Library, Mr. Crevecoeur, of the Fraser Institute, and
to other representatives of public and private libraries. To Mr. E. Z.
Massicotte, the careful archivist of the district of Montreal, I am
especially indebted for much courteous and valuable assistance of which
the following pages will give many indications. In general, the sources
consulted are sufficiently indicated in the text or foot notes. They
will be seen to be the best available.

I beg to thank those who have helped me to illustrate the work and
particularly Mr. Edgar Gariépy, who has keenly aided me.

The story of Montreal, as far as authentic historical documents are
concerned, begins with Saturday, October 2, 1535. On that day, the
Indian natives of Hochelaga had been quickly apprised that two strange
large vessels containing many palefaced wanderers, wonderfully attired
and speaking an unknown tongue, had come up the river, and were now
lying off its sloping margin. The people immediately prepare quickly
to receive them with a hospitality of which we shall hear. The women
busy themselves in preparing their presents while the men hurriedly run
down the hill slope to the water's edge, to be soon also followed by
the women and children. There they found a good gathering of swarthy
and bronzed men of the sea, mariners from St. Malo, to the number of
twenty-eight, simple men, but adored by the natives as superior beings.
All hail to them! Would that of the seventy-four[1] names we have
preserved to us, of those who sailed from St. Malo, we had those of
them who were privileged to come up to Hochelaga, as we must yet call
it.

Besides the sailors, there are, however, six whose dress and bearing
mark them out as men of some distinction, as indeed they are; for one
is Claude du Pont Briand, cup bearer to My Lord the Dauphin; the second
and third, gentlemen adventurers of some rank, Charles de la Pommeraye
and Jehan Gouion; the fourth and fifth are the bronzed and rugged
captains of the small fleet lying down the river at Lake St. Peter,
Guillaume le Breton, captain of the Emerillon, and Marc Jalobert,
captain of the Petite Hermine, brother-in-law of the sixth. This last,
a firm set man of forty-five years, and of commanding appearance,
is none other than Jacques Cartier, captain of the Grande Hermine,
pilot and captain general of the fleet, and he has come with a royal
commission[2] explore new seas and lands for his sovereign maste
Francis I of France, whose flags proudly wave from the prows of either
vessel now tossing in the Hochelagan waters.

Jacques Cartier claims notice, for he is at once the discoverer and
the first historian of Montreal. He is a mariner, of a dignified
profession, and was born in 1491, though De Costa and others say, in
1494, at the seaport of St. Malo in Brittany, the fertile cradle of
many hardy daring corsairs and adventurers on the waters. Early the
young son of Jamet Cartier and Geseline Jansart seems to have turned
his thoughts to a seafaring life as he met the bronzed mariners
arriving at the wharves of St. Malo, and telling strange stories of
their perils and triumphs. On the 2d of May, 1519, being now a master
pilot, he married Catherine des Granches, the daughter of the high
constable of the city.

We know only imperfectly of his wanderings on the sea after this. He
seems to have gone to Brazil. But he probably joined the band of those
Norman ships going to Newfoundland on their fishing expeditions, and
became well acquainted with the waters thereabout, and able to pilot
them to some good purpose.

How Cartier became interested in discovering the passage to the
Northwest we do not know; though it was the dream of so many navigators
at that time to find a way to China and the east ports of India. To the
man who should find it there would be undying fame, and many there were
who strove for it. Probably Cartier believed that he should find the
long expected route to India through one of the openings in the coast
in the vicinity of Newfoundland, then thought to be but a projection
of the eastern coast of Asia! At any rate, in 1533, we find him being
introduced to Francis I of France by the high admiral of France,
Phillipe Chabot, Sieur de Brion, to endeavour to persuade the king to
allow him the means to secure the western passage for his royal master
and the flag of France. The permission was granted, the vice admiral,
the Sieur de Meilleraye personally undertaking to supervise the
equipment of the vessels, and Cartier now is to be ranked among those
others whose names have come down to us as leaders of expeditions.

[Illustration: This wooden medallion, 20 inches in diameter, bears on
the back the deeply carved date 1704 and the initials J. C. It was
found between outer and inner "skins" of an ancient house in the French
fishing village of Cape des Roziers at the mouth of the St. Lawrence
River, November, 1908, and was the stern shield of some French vessel
wrecked on that coast. The face is alleged to be that of Jacques
Cartier, the discoverer of Canada, and is the oldest known portrait of
him. The claim is made by Dr. John M. Clarke of Albany, state geologist
of New York.]

We next find him armed with the Royal Commission, preparing to fit
his vessels, and seeking for St. Malo men to man them in the service
of the king. He had his difficulties in meeting the obstructions and
jealousies that stood in his way. But on the 20th of April, 1534, he
sailed with pilots, masters and seamen to the number of sixty, who were
solemnly sworn by the vice admiral, Sieur de Meilleraye. It is not the
purpose of this book to describe the discovery of Canada which Cartier
made on this first voyage although the task is a fascinating one, since
we have his own recital to follow. On July 24th, having planted on the
coast of Gaspé a cross of the length of thirty feet bearing a shield
adorned with the _fleur-de-lys_ and inscribed "Vive le Roi de France,"
he made preparations for the return home, reaching St. Malo on
September 5th.

But he had not, as yet, stumbled upon the discovery of the mouth of the
St. Lawrence, up which the kingdom of the Hochelagans lay, on which we
are to fix our gaze. The news of his discoveries were received with
enthusiasm, and on the Friday in Pentecost week, May 19, 1535, we find
Jacques Cartier and his men sailing away from St. Malo, after having
confessed themselves and received the benedictions of the archbishop
and the godspeeds of their friends. The names of those accompanying
Cartier--"pilots, masters and seamen, and others"--are preserved in
the archives of St. Malo, numbering seventy-four, of whom several were
of some distinction and twelve at least were related to him by blood
or marriage, some led thither perhaps by the hope of trade. Two of the
names are those of Dom Guillaume le Breton and Dom Antoine. It has
been claimed the title Dom indicates that they were probably secular
priests, and acted as chaplains, according to the general custom when
the expedition was a royal mission. But this is not likely; in this
case Guillaume le Breton was the captain of the Emerillon. Among those
not mentioned in the list of Carrier's men were two young Indians,
Taignoagny and Agaya, whom Cartier had seized at Gaspé before leaving
to return to France, after his first voyages, and whose appearance
in France created unusual interest. These were now to be useful as
interpreters to the tribes to be visited. Cartier had however to regret
some of their dealings on his behalf. Charity begins at home and so it
did with these French-veneered Indians on mingling with their own.

The Royal Commission signed by Phillipe de Chabot, admiral of France,
and giving greeting "to the Captain and Master Pilot Jacques Cartier of
St. Malo," dated October 31, 1534, may here be quoted in part.

"We have commissioned and deputed, commission and depute you by the
will and command of the King to conduct, direct, and employ three
ships, equipped and provisioned each for fifteen months for the
accomplishment of the voyage to the lands by you already begun and
discovered beyond the Newlands; * * * the said three ships you shall
take, and hire the number of pilots, masters and seamen as shall seem
to you to be fitting and necessary for the accomplishment of this
voyage. * * * We charge and command all the said pilots, masters and
seamen, and others who shall be on the same ships, to obey and follow
you for the service of the King in this as above, as they would do to
ourselves, without any contradiction or refusal, and this under pains
customary in such cases to those who are found disobedient and acting
contrary."

[Illustration: JACQUES CARTIER'S SHIPS IN THE ST. LAWRENCE]

[Illustration: THE CLOSING PORTION OF JACQUES CARTIER'S LIST OF SEAMEN]

The three ships that had been assigned to him were the Grande Hermine,
the Petite Hermine and the Emerillon, the first being a tall ship of
126 burthen and the others of sixty and forty respectively, and they
were provisioned for fifteen months. How the expedition encountered
storms and tempests, delaying its progress until they reached the
Strait of St. Peter, where familiar objects began to meet the eyes of
the captive Indians on board; how they eagerly pointed out to Cartier
the way into Canada; how they told him of the gold to be found in the
land of the Saguenay; how Cartier visited the lordly Donnacona, lord of
Canada; how at last on his resolve to pursue the journey to the land
of Hochelaga he found himself in the great river of Canada which he
named St. Lawrence; how he passed up the river by mountain and lowland,
headlands and harbours, meadows, brush and forests, scattering saints'
names on his way to Stadaconé[3] whence he determined to push his way
to Hochelaga before winter--can be read at length in the recital of the
second voyage of Jacques Cartier.

[Illustration: A CONFERENCE WITH THE INDIANS AT STADACONE]

It is legitimate only for us to place before our readers that part
concerning the approach to Hochelaga. Hitherto, on his journey, Cartier
had received all help in his progress from the friendly natives; but
effort was made to dissuade him from going up to Hochelaga. Cartier,
however, always made reply that notwithstanding every difficulty he
would go there if it were possible to him "because he had commandment
from the king to go the farthest that he could." On the contrary the
lordly savage Donnacona and the two captives, Dom Agaya and Taignoagny,
used every device to turn the captain from his quest. An attempt will
be made hereafter to prevent a visit to Montreal as we shall see when
we speak of Maisonneuve and the settlement of Ville Marie.

[Illustration: MANUSCRIPT OF NO. 5589 OF CARTIER'S SECOND VOYAGE]

Carrier's account has the following for September 18th:[4]

     "HOW THE SAID DONNACONA, TAIGNOAGNY, AND OTHERS DEVISED AN
     ARTIFICE AND HAD THREE MEN DRESSED IN THE GUISE OF DEVILS,
     FEIGNING TO HAVE COME FROM CUDOUAGNY, THEIR GOD, FOR TO HINDER US
     FROM GOING TO THE SAID HOCHELAGA.[5]

"The next day, the 18th of the said month, thinking always to hinder
us from going to Hochelaga, they devised a grand scheme which they
effected thus: They had three men attired in the style of three devils,
that had horns as long as one's arms, and were clothed in skins of
dogs, black and white, and had their faces painted as black as coal,
and they caused them to be put into one of their boats unknown to
us, and then came with their band near our ships as they had been
accustomed, who kept themselves in the woods without appearing for two
hours, waiting till the time and the tide should come for the arrival
of the said boat, at which time they all came forth, and presented
themselves before our said ships without approaching them as they
were wont to do; and asked them if they wanted to have the boat,
whereupon the said Taignoagny replied to them, not at that time, but
that presently he would enter into the said ships. And suddenly came
the said boat wherein were the three men appearing to be three devils,
having put horns on their heads, and he in the midst made a marvelous
speech in coming, and they passed along our ships with their said boat,
without in any wise turning their looks toward us, and went on striking
and running on shore with their said boat; and, all at once, the said
Lord Donnacona and his people seized the said boat and the said three
men, the which were let fall to the bottom of it like dead men, and
they carried the whole together into the woods, which were distant
from the said ships a stone's throw; and not a single person remained
before our said ships, but all withdrew themselves. And they, having
retired, began a declamation and a discourse that we heard from our
ships, which lasted half an hour. After which the said Taignoagny and
Dom Agaya marched from the said woods toward us, having their hands
joined, and their hats under their elbows, causing great admiration.
And the said Taignoagny began to speak and cry out three times, 'Jesus!
Jesus! Jesus!' raising his eyes toward heaven. Then Dom Agaya began
to say, 'Jesus Maria! Jacques Cartier,' looking toward heaven like
the other, the captain seeing their gestures and ceremonies, began to
ask what was the matter, and what it was new that had happened, who
responded that there were piteous news, saying 'Nenny, est il bon,' and
the said captain demanded of them afresh what it was, and they replied
that their God, named Cudouagny, had spoken at Hochelaga, and that the
three men aforesaid had come from him to announce to them the tidings
that there was so much ice and snow that they would all die. With which
words we all fell to laughing and to tell that their God Cudouagny was
but a fool, and that he knew not what he said, and that they should
say it to his messengers and that Jesus would guard them well from the
cold if they would believe in him. And then the said Taignoagny and
his companion asked the said captain if he had spoken to Jesus and he
replied that his priests[6] had spoken to him and that he would make
fair weather; whereupon they thanked the said captain very much, and
returned into the woods to tell the news to the others, who came out
of the said woods immediately, feigning to be delighted with the said
words thus spoken by the said captain. And to show that they were
delighted with them, as soon as they were before the ships they began
with a common voice to utter three shrieks and howls, which is their
token of joy, and betook themselves to dancing and singing, as they
had done from custom. But for conclusion, the said Taignoagny and Dom
Agaya told our said captain that the said Donnacona would not that any
of them should go with him to Hochelaga if he did not leave a hostage,
who should abide ashore with the said Donnacona. To which he replied to
them that if they had not decided to go there with good courage they
might remain and that for him he would not leave off making efforts to
go there."

We have seen the manifest disinclination of Donnacona's party to
allow the discoverers to proceed to Hochelaga. Was it because the
Hochelagans were a hostile people or was it from selfish reasons to
keep the presents of the generous strangers for themselves? At any
rate, Cartier sets out for Hochelaga and on Tuesday, September 26th,
enters Lake St. Peter with a pinnace and two boats. This lake was not
named by Cartier, but subsequently it was named Lac d'Angoulesme,
either in honour of his birthplace or more probably that of Francis
I, who was Count of Angoulême. It was left for Champlain entering upon
the lake, on the feast of SS. Peter and Paul, June 29, 1603, to give
it its present name. Cartier's pinnace could not cross Lake St. Peter
owing to the shallowness of the water[7] which forced him to take the
boats to Hochelaga, starting about six miles below St. Mary's current.
The journey through Lake St. Peter and the arrival at Hochelaga must
now be followed in the words of Jacques Cartier, the first historian of
Montreal (Phinney Baxter, pp. 157-171).

[Illustration: THE RECEPTION OF JACQUES CARTIER AT HOCHELAGA

(A section of the palisaded town is shown. D in the center is King
Agohama's abode.)]

"The said twenty-eighth day of September we came into a great lake
and shoal of the said river, about five or six leagues broad and
twelve long, and navigated that day up the said lake without finding
shallowing or deepening, and coming to one of the ends of the said
lake, not any passage or egress appeared to us; it seemed rather to be
completely closed without any stream. And we found at the said end but
a fathom and a half, wherefore it behooved us to lay to and heave out
our anchor, and go to seek passage with our boats. And we found that
there were four or five streams all flowing from the said river into
this lake and coming from the said Hochelaga; but, by their flowing out
so, there are bars and passages made by the course of the water, where
there was then only a fathom in depth. And the said bars being passed,
there are four or five fathoms, which was at the time of year of the
lowest waters, as we saw by the flow of the said waters that they
increased more than two fathoms by pike.

"All these streams flow by and surround five or six fair islands[8]
which form the head of said lake; then they come together about fifteen
leagues above all into one. That day we went to one of them, where
we found five men, who were hunting wild beasts, the which came as
familiarly to our boats as if they had seen us all their lives, without
having fear or apprehension; and our said boats having come to land,
one of these men took our captain in his arms and carried him ashore as
lightly as he would have carried a child of five years, so large and
strong was this man. We found they had a great pile of wild rats,[9]
which live in the water, and are as large as rabbits, and wonderfully
good to eat, of which they made a present to our captain, who gave them
knives and paternosters for recompense. We asked them by sign if that
was the way to Hochelaga; they answered us yes, and that it was still
three days journey to go there.

     "HOW THE CAPTAIN HAD THE BOATS FITTED OUT FOR TO GO TO THE SAID
     HOCHELAGA, AND LEFT THE PINNACE, OWING TO THE DIFFICULTY OF THE
     PASSAGE; AND HOW HE CAME TO THE SAID HOCHELAGA, AND THE RECEPTION
     THAT THE PEOPLE GAVE US AT OUR ARRIVAL.

"The next day our captain, seeing that it was not possible then to be
able to pass the said pinnace, had the boats victualed and fitted out,
and put in provisions for the longest time that he possibly could and
that the said boats could take in, and set out with them accompanied
with a part of the gentlemen,--to wit, Claude du Pont Briand, grand
cupbearer to my lord the Dauphin, Charles de la Pommeraye, Jehan
Gouion, with twenty-eight mariners, including with them Marc Jalobert
and Guillaume le Breton, having the charge under the said Cartier,--for
to go up the said river the farthest that it might be possible for us.
And we navigated with weather at will until the second day of October,
when we arrived at the said Hochelaga, which is about forty-five
leagues distant from the place where the said pinnace was left, during
which time and on the way we found many folks of the country, the which
brought fish and other victuals, dancing and showing great joy at our
coming. And to attract and hold them in amity with us, the said captain
gave them for recompense some knives, paternosters, and other trivial
goods, with which they were much content. And we having arrived at
the said Hochelaga, more than a thousand persons presented themselves
before us, men, women and children alike, the which gave us a good
reception as ever father did to child, showing marvelous joy; for the
men in one band danced, the women on the other side and the children on
the other, the which brought us store of fish and of their bread made
of coarse millet,[10] which they cast into our said boats in the way
that it seemed as if it tumbled from the air. Seeing this, our said
captain landed with a number of his men, and as soon as he was landed
they gathered all about him, and about all the others, giving them an
unrestrained welcome. And the women brought their children in their
arms to make them touch the said captain and others, making a rejoicing
which lasted more than half an hour. And our captain, witnessing their
liberality and good will, caused all the women to be seated and ranged
in order, and gave them certain paternosters of tin and other trifling
things, and to a part of the men knives. Then he retired on board the
said boats to sup and pass the night, while these people remained on
the shore of the said river nearest the said boats all night making
fires and dancing, crying all the time 'Aguyaze,' which is their
expression of mirth and joy.

     "HOW THE CAPTAIN WITH GENTLEMEN, AND TWENTY-FIVE SEAMEN, WELL
     ARMED AND IN GOOD ORDER, WENT TO THE TOWN OF HOCHELAGA, AND OF THE
     SITUATION OF THE SAID PLACE.

"The next day, in the early morning, the captain attired himself
and had his men put in order to go to see the town and habitation
of the said people, and a mountain that is adjacent to their said
town, whither the gentleman and twenty mariners went with the said
captain, and left the rest for the guard of the boats, and took three
men of the said Town of Hochelaga to bring and conduct them to the
said place. And we, being on the road, found it as well beaten as it
might be possible to behold, and the fairest and best land, all full
of oaks as fine as there be in a forest of France under the which all
the ground was covered with acorns. And we, having marched about a
league and a half, found on the way one of the chief lords of the Town
of Hochelaga, accompanied by a number of persons, the which made us a
sign that we should rest at the said place near a fire that they had
made by the said road, which we did, and then the said lord began to
make a discourse and oration, as heretofore is said to be their custom
of showing joy and familiarity, this lord thereby showing welcome to
the said captain and his company; the which captain gave him a couple
of hatchets and a couple of knives, with a cross and memorial of the
crucifixion, which he made him kiss, and hung it on his neck, for
which he rendered thanks to the said captain. This done, we marched
farther on, and about half a league from there we began to find the
land cultivated, and fair, large fields full of grain of their country,
which is like Brazil millet, as big or bigger than peas, on which
they live just as we do on wheat; and in the midst of these fields
is located and seated the Town of Hochelaga, near to and adjoining a
mountain, which is cultivated round about it and highly fertile, from
the summit of which one sees a very great distance. We named the said
mountain Mont Royal. The said town is quite round and inclosed with
timbers in three rows in the style of a pyramid, crossed at the top,
having the middle row in the style of a perpendicular line; and ranged
with timbers laid along, well joined and tied in their manner, and
is in height about two pikes. There is in this town but one gate and
entrance, which fastens with bars, upon which and in many places of
the said inclosure there are kinds of galleries and ladders to mount
to them, which are furnished with rocks and stones for the guard and
defense of it.

"There are within this town about fifty long houses of about fifty
paces or more each, and twelve or fifteen paces wide and all made of
timbers covered and garnished with great pieces of bark and strips of
the said timber, as broad as tables, well tied artificially according
to their manner. And within these there are many lodgings and chambers,
and in the middle of these houses there is a great room on the ground
where they make their fire and live in common; after that the men
retire with their wives and children to their said chambers. Likewise
they have granaries at the top of their houses where they put their
corn of which they make their bread, which they call 'carraconny,'[11]
and they make it in the manner following: They have mortars of wood
as for braying flax, and beat the said corn into powder with pestles
of wood; then they mix it into paste and make round cakes of it,
which they put on a broad stone which is hot; then they cover it with
hot stones, and so bake their bread instead of in an oven. They make
likewise many stews of the said corn, and beans and peas of which they
have enough, and also of big cucumbers and other fruits. They have also
in their houses great vessels like tons, where they put their fish,
eels and others, the which they dry in the smoke during the summer and
live upon it in the winter. And of this they make a great store, as we
have seen by experience. All their living is without any taste of salt,
and they lie on barks of trees stretched upon the earth, with wretched
coverings of skins from which they make their clothing--namely, wolves,
beavers, martens, foxes, wild cats, deer, stags, and other wild beasts;
but the most part of them go almost entirely naked. The most precious
thing that they have in their world is 'esnogny,'[12] the which is
white as snow, and they take it into the same river from the
cornibotz[13] in the manner which follows: When a man heserved
death, or when they have taken any enemies in war, they kill them, then
cut them into the buttocks, thighs, and shoulders with great gashes;
afterward in the places where the said esnogny is they sink the said
body to the bottom of the water, and leave it ten or twelve hours,
then draw it up and find within the said gashes and incisions the said
cornibots, of which they make bead money and use it as we do gold and
silver, and hold it the most precious thing in the world. It has the
virtue of stanching blood from the nostrils, because we have tried it.

"All the said people give themselves only to tillage and fishing for a
living; for the goods of this world they make no account, because they
have no knowledge of them, and as they budge not from their country,
and do not go about like those of Canada[14] and of the Saguenay.
Notwithstanding the said Canadians are their subjects, with eight or
nine other peoples who are upon the said river.

     "HOW WE ARRIVED AT THE SAID TOWN AND OF THE RECEPTION WHICH WAS
     MADE UP THERE, AND HOW THE CAPTAIN MADE THEM PRESENTS; AND OTHER
     THINGS THAT THE SAID CAPTAIN DID, AS SHALL BE SEEN IN THIS CHAPTER.

"When we had arrived near the town, a great number of the inhabitants
of it presented themselves before us, who after their fashion of doing,
gave us a good reception; and by our guides and conductors we were
brought to the middle of the town, where there was a place between the
houses the extent of a stone's throw or about in a square, who made
us a sign that we should stop at the said place, which we did. And
suddenly all the women and girls of the said town assembled together,
a part of whom were burdened with children in their arms, and who came
to us to stroke our faces, arms, and other places upon our bodies
that they could touch; weeping with joy to see us; giving us the best
welcome that was possible to them, and making signs to us that it might
please us to touch their said children. After the which things the men
made the women retire, and seated themselves on the ground about us,
as if we might wish to play a mystery. And, suddenly, a number of men
came again, who brought each a square mat in the fashion of a carpet,
and spread them out upon the ground in the middle of the said place
and made us rest upon them. After which things were thus done there
was brought by nine or ten men the king and lord of the country, whom
they all call in their language Agohanna, who was seated upon a great
skin of a stag; and they came to set him down in the said place upon
the said mats beside our captain, making us a sign that he was their
lord and king. This Agohanna was about the age of fifty years and was
not better appareled than the others, save that he had about his head a
kind of red band for a crown, made of the quills of porcupines and this
lord was wholly impotent and diseased in his limbs.

"After he had made his sign of salutation to the said captain and to
his folks, making them evident signs that they should make them very
welcome, he showed his arms and legs to the said captain, praying that
he would touch them, as though he would beg healing and health from
him; and then the captain began to stroke his arms and legs with his
hands; whereupon the said Agohanna took the band and crown that he
had upon his head and gave it to our captain: and immediately there
were brought to the said captain many sick ones, as blind, one-eyed,
lame, impotent, and folks so very old that the lids of their eyes hung
down even upon their cheeks, setting and laying them down nigh to our
said captain for him to touch them, so that it seemed as if God had
descended there in order to cure them.

"Our said captain, seeing the mystery and faith of this said people,
recited the Gospel of St. John; to wit, the _In principio_, making the
sign of the cross on the poor sick ones, praying God that he might give
them knowledge of our holy faith and the passion of our Saviour, and
the grace to receive Christianity and baptism. Then our said captain
took a prayer book and read full loudly, word by word, the passion of
our Lord, so that all the bystanders could hear it, while all these
poor people kept a great silence and were marvelously good hearers,
looking up to heaven and making the same ceremonies that they saw us
make; after which the captain made all the men range themselves on one
side, the women on another, and the children another, and gave to the
chiefs hatchets, to the others knives, and to the women paternosters
and other trifling articles; then he threw into the midst of the place
among the little children some small rings and Agnus Dei of tin, at
which they showed a marvelous joy. This done the said captain commanded
the trumpets and other instruments of music to sound, with which the
said people were greatly delighted; after which things we took leave of
them and withdrew. Seeing this, the women put themselves before us for
to stop us, and brought us of their victuals, which they had prepared
for us, as fish, stews, beans and other things, thinking to make us eat
and dine at the said place; and because their victuals were not to our
taste and had no savor of salt, we thanked them, making them a sign
that we did not need to eat.

"After we had issued from the said town many men and women came to
conduct us upon the mountain aforesaid, which was by us named Mont
Royal, distant from the said place some quarter of a league; and
we, being upon this mountain, had sight and observance of more than
thirty leagues round about it. Toward the north of which is a range
of mountains which stretches east and west, and toward the south as
well; between which mountains the land is the fairest that it may be
possible to see, smooth, level, and tillable; and in the middle of the
said lands we saw the said river, beyond the place where our boats were
left, where there is a waterfall,[15] the most impetuous that it may
be possible to see, and which it was impossible for us to pass. And we
saw this river as far as we could discern, grand, broad and extensive,
which flowed toward the southwest and passed near three fair, round
mountains which we saw and estimated that they were about fifteen
leagues from us. And we were told and shown by signs by our said three
men of the country who had conducted us that there were three such
falls of water on the said river like that where our said boats were,
but we could not understand what the distance was between the one and
the other. Then they showed us by signs that, the said falls being
passed, one could navigate more than three moons by the said river; and
beyond they showed us that along the said mountains, being toward the
north, there is a great stream, which descends from the west like the
said river.[16] We reckoned that this is the stream which passed by
the realm and province of Saguenay, and, without having made them any
request or sign, they took the chain from the captain's whistle, which
was of silver, and the haft of a poniard, the which was of copper,
yellow like gold, which hung at the side of one of our mariners, and
showed that it came from above the said river, and that there were
Agojuda, which is to say evil folk, the which are armed even to the
fingerhowing us the style of their armor, which is of cords and of
wood laced and woven together, giving us to understand that the said
Agojuda carried on continual war against one another; but by default
of speech we could not learn how far it was to the said country. Our
captain showed them some red copper,[17] which they call _caignetdaze_,
pointing them toward the said place, and asking by signs if it came
from there, and they began to shake their heads, saying no, and showing
that it came from Saguenay, which is to the contrary of the preceding.
After which things thus seen and understood, we withdrew to our boats,
which was not without being conducted by a great number of the said
people, of which part of them, when they saw our folk weary, loaded
them upon themselves, as upon horsesd carried them. And we, having
arrived at our said boats, made sail to return to our pinnace, for
doubt that there might be some hindrance; which departure was not made
without great regret of the said people, for as far as they could
follow us down the said river they would follow us, and we accomplished
so much that we arrived at our said pinnace Monday, the fourth day of
October."

The reader must have been struck with the pride of the Hochelagans in
conducting their visitors to the mountain as well as at the accurate
and picturesque description given by Cartier of the scene that met
his delighted gaze. Today the same beautiful sight may be seen by
the visitor who makes his way to the "lookout" or the observatory.
The landscape at his feet has been covered with a busy city and its
suburbs, its manufactories, its public buildings and its homes and
villas, but still it appears as if all these were peeping out of a
garden. All around the green fields and pleasant meadows are there as
of yore. From this height the disfigurements of the lower city are not
visible. Montreal has been described as a beautiful lady handsomely
gowned, but whose skirt fringes are sadly mud and dust stained.

The river has been spanned by gigantic bridges but the main grand
lines of the landscape are those that Cartier gazed upon. There at the
south is the great St. Lawrence with its islands on its bosom, now
studded with ocean going steamers; beyond there is the great sweep
of the St. Lawrence Valley, broken abruptly by the solitary mountain
ridges of Montarville, St. Bruno, Beloeil, Rougemont, Yamaska, and
Mount Johnson--a volcanic sisterhood of which Mount Royal is itself a
member--and hemmed in on the horizon by the cloudlike ridges of the
Green and Adirondack mountains. Looking to the west are the Lachine
Rapids and beyond the Lake St. Louis, and to the north the Rivière des
Prairies or the Back River is seen, at the head of which lies the
bright surface of the Lake of the Two Mountains. Far away hemming in
the horizon on that side runs the hoary Laurentian Range, the oldest
hills known to geology. All this apart from the works of civilization
Cartier saw from the mountain which has only of late years been planned
to intensify its beauty and usefulness. We are now looking forward to
the day when that same city around the mountain will also bear the mark
of an intelligible plan to intensify the beauty of the city and make
it by art, as it is by nature, one of the finest cities in the world,
worthy of the jewel standing out--the pride of its city--Mount Royal.
Cartier saw the island from the point of view of Greater Mount Royal.
In this he resembles those who today see a Greater Montreal. Modern
Hochelagans are as proud of their mountain as those of old. D'Arcy
McGee imagines Jacques Cartier telling of it on his return to St. Malo:

    He told them of the Algonquin braves--the hunters of the wild,
    Of how the Indian mother in the forest rocks her child;
    Of how, poor souls, they fancy in every living thing
    A spirit good or evil, that claims their worshipping;
    Of how they brought their sick and maim'd for him to breathe upon,
    And of the wonders wrought for them through the Gospel of St. John.

    He told them of the river whose mighty current gave
    Its freshness for a hundred leagues to Ocean's briny wave;
    He told them of the glorious scene presented to his sight,
    What time he rear'd the cross and crown on Hochelaga's height,
    And of the fortress cliff that keeps of Canada the key,
    And they welcomed back Jacques Cartier from his perils o'er the sea.

On Tuesday, September 4th, Jacques Cartier regained his pinnace and on
Wednesday, September 5th, he passed thence on his way to Stadaconé.
At Stadaconé, on May 3d, the festival of the Holy Cross, he planted
the cross and inscribed it with the royal name and title, "Franciscus
Primus Dei Gratia." There he treacherously seized Donnacona and his
friends Dom Agaya and Taignoagny and took them to France. On July 6th,
1636, he reached St. Malo "by the grace of the Creator, whom we pray,
making an end of our navigation to grant us his grace and Paradise at
the end. Amen."


CARTIER'S SECOND VISIT TO HOCHELAGA, 1540

When Cartier appeared before the King, Francis I, after his second
voyage there is no doubt that he would have enthusiastically
recommended the country of Hochelaga, especially that island, on which
was the mountain to which he had given the title "Mont Royal" as the
site of a settlement, for in Jacques Cartier's commission, dated
October 17, 1540, in preparation for the third voyage, we read:

"And among others we have sent there our dear and well beloved
Jacques Cartier, who has discovered the large countries of Canada and
Hochelaga, making an end of Asia, on the western side, which country
he found, as he reported to us, furnished with many good commodities,
and the people thereof well formed in body and limb, and well disposed
in spirit and understanding, of whom he likewise brought us a certain
number, whom we have for a long time supported and instructed in our
holy faith[18] with our said subjects, in consideration of which and
seeing their good intentions, we have considered and decided to send
back the said Cartier to the said country of Canada and Hochelaga,
and as far as the land of Saguenay, if we can reach there with a
good number of ships of our said subjects of good intentions and of
all conditions, arts and industries, in order to enter farther into
the said countries to converse with the said peoples thereof, and
if necessary, live with them in order to accomplish better our said
intention and to do a thing agreeable to God our Creator and Redeemer
and which may be for the promoting of his holy sacred name and of our
mother the Holy Catholic church, of which we are called and named the
first son."

Yet before he signed this commission five years had passed. For up to
this Francis had troubles enough at home, with his kingdom invaded by
Charles V of Spain and his throne threatened, to prevent his giving
thought to Hochelaga in the West. But on June 15, 1538, the truce
between France and Spain gave him more leisure for colonization schemes
and the extension of the empire. Especially did he desire it to turn
to the western hemisphere, for he looked with jealous eyes upon the
activity of the King of Spain in that direction. "I should like to see
the clause in our father Adam's will which bequeathed to him this fine
heritage."

There is no doubt that Cartier's action in seizing Donnacona,
Taignoagny and Dom Agaya and others, and taking them to France, from
which they never returned, was the beginning of the cause of the
hostility of the Indians. At first these had received Cartier kindly,
but they could not be expected to forget this treachery in the loss
of their friends. Mather, alluding to a similar piece of treachery by
an English captain some time before the arrival of the Pilgrim Colony
declares that "it laid the foundation of grievous annoyances to all the
English endeavors of settlements, especially in the northern parts of
the island, for several years ensuing. The Indians would never forget
or forgive this injury."

We have no record of Hochelaga till September 7-11, 1540. For this we
are again indebted to Cartier's account of his third voyage. Luckily
this has been partially preserved in Hakluyt's translation, which
is that of the "Bref Récit," the only version known. On Wednesday
(September 7, 1541) Cartier left the proposed French settlement,
Charlesbourg Royal, about four leagues beyond the harbour of St. Croix,
with two boats, to visit Hochelaga and the rapids above it. Following
Hakluyt we learn:

"How after the departure of the two ships which were sent back to
Brittany, and that the fort was begun to be builded, the captain
prepared two boats to go up the great river to discover the passage of
the three saults or falls of the river." While awaiting the arrival of
Roberval in command of the first colonizing party Cartier went up to
the sault from Charlesbourg Royal on September 7th, "and we sailed with
so prosperous a wind that we arrived the 11th day of the month at the
first sault of water, which is two leagues distant from the Town of
Tutonaguy."[19]

There is no further description of Tutonaguy, which we take to be the
site of Montreal. Cartier mentions that finding it impossible to get up
against the course of the sault he came on shore to a beaten path going
towards the first sault. "And on the way and soon after, we found an
habitation of people which made us great cheer and entertained us very
hospitably." Four young men conducted them to another hospitable people
who lived over against the second sault. We may perhaps conclude that
those of the first sault were islanders of Montreal and we are pleased
that their hospitality was forthcoming as is always that of our modern
city. But we regret that Jacques Cartier appears to have made no stay
at Tutonaguy.

With this we take leave of Cartier. Canadians have one grudge against
him, for there seems no doubt that his description of the severity of
our climate delayed colonization here, but his account of Montreal
is satisfactory to us. We are not writing his life, but Montreal can
rejoice in having been discovered by a worthy man. We are glad that
Francis I recognized his merits as we find him spoken of, in an act of
the Chapter of St. Malo, September 29, 1549, as Sieur de Limoilou, and
in another act, of February 5, 1550, as a "noble man." Unfortunately as
he did not leave any child by his wife, Catherine Desgranges, he did
not pass on his title of nobility to anyone. Jacques Cartier is worthy
of recognition as among the great men of his time, and Montreal is
proud of its discoverer and first historian.


ROBERVAL'S PROBABLE VISIT TO HOCHELAGA, 1542

The next French visit to Hochelaga can only be surmised. We have the
record as follows, which gives us an indication of such a possible
visit: It is found in Hakluyt's description of the

"COURSE OF JEAN ALPHONSE, CHIEF PILOT TO MONSIEUR ROBERVAL 1542.

"By the nature of the climate the lands towards Hochelaga are better
and better and more fruitful; and this land is fit for figs and pears;
and I think that gold and silver will be found here according as the
people of the country say." It is likely that it received a visit from
"John Francis de la Rocque, knight, Lord of Roberval," whose voyage
from his fort in Canada is related by Hakluyt "to the countries of
Canada, Saguenay and Hochelaga with three tall ships and 200 persons,
both men and women, and children, begun in April, 1542, in which parts
he remained the same summer and all the next winter." On the 6th of
June about 6 o'clock in the morning, Monsieur Roberval, the king's
lieutenant general in the countries of Canada, Saguenay and Hochelaga,
"set sail for the country of the Saguenay and sailed against the stream
in which voyage their whole furniture was of eight barks, as well great
as small and to the number of three score and ten persons, with the
aforesaid general." Unfortunately the rest of this voyage is wanting.
We know that de Roberval's party contained many undesirables and not
good matter for citizenship and we are glad, that if these did visit
Montreal, they did not stay there.

Montreal would never have been proud of itself with such an origin.


NOTE I

THE SITE OF HOCHELAGA

Where did Jacques Cartier land on the island of Montreal in 1535? We
should very much like to know this. All we know is the naming of the
mountain. There is a portion of Montreal called Hochelaga, being to
the southwest of the present city, but there is no contention that
this is the original part of the island, on which Jacques Cartier
landed. The "Bref Récit" of Cartier's voyage states that he landed two
leagues from the Indian town, which was a quarter of a league from the
mountain. Hakluyt makes the latter distance a league. The Abbé Faillon
in "La Colonie Française" thinks that Cartier ascended the river to the
Lachine Rapids. There is more reason to believe he stayed on his way
opposite Nun's Island. A theory advanced in November 19, 1860, by Sir
William Dawson, principal of McGill College, in a discourse before the
Natural History Society of Montreal, locates the site of Hochelaga in
the space between Metcalfe and Mansfield streets in one direction and
Burnside Place and Sherbrooke Street in the other.

"Doctor Dawson founded his opinion after the examination of some
Indian relics excavated by some workmen in November, 1860, near
Mansfield Street, in the sandy ridge of a terrace immediately north of
Sherbrooke Street. They exhumed two skeletons, and with them or near
them were found jawbones of a beaver and of a dog, with a fragment of
an earthen vessel and of a hollow cylinder of red clay. The skeletons
were in a sitting or crouching posture, as was the mode of burial
with certain early Indian tribes. Among other relics previously found
and exhibited on this occasion was an instrument made of bone, found
among the remains, which exactly fitted the marks on some of the
pottery, the large end having been fashioned like a cup, and the small
end artificially tapered to a point. There were also several knives
and chisels of sharpened bone, in tolerable preservation and some
singular counters which are supposed to have been used in play, the
Indians being inveterate gamblers. The most interesting relics were
tobacco pipes, handsomely fashioned in the shape of lotus flowers,
with the hole through the stem perfectly preserved. I have thought
it well to enumerate these finds because they are now at the Natural
History Museum of the city, and several gentlemen, antiquarians and
archæologists have also private collections of their own. May not
they serve the reader's imagination to conjure up and reconstruct for
himself a picture of the village life of the earliest known inhabitants
of Montreal in place of a labored description of the present
writer."[20]

Describing Cartier's walk toward Hochelaga Mr. Stanley Bagg (Numa),
in the "Canadian Antiquarian and Numismatic Journal, July, 1873, Vol.
II, p. 14, says: "Where the brook crosses McGill College ground, he
was met by a deputation of the aborigines; afterwards he came into the
presence of their king, was conducted through corn-fields to the town
and subsequently ascended the mountain. Cartier's description of the
locality, taken in connection with the statement of the missionaries,
and the discovery of Indian antiquities, place the Town of Hochelaga on
the space between Mansfield Street to a little west of Metcalfe Street
in one direction and in the other from a little south of Burnside Place
to within sixty yards of Sherbrooke Street. In this area, several
skeletons, hundreds of old fireplaces, indications of huts, bones of
wild animals, pottery and implements of stone and bone have been found."


NOTE II

HOCHELAGA CIVILIZATION

In order to present a picture of these early settlers around Mount
Royal the following description from Jacques Cartier's second voyage
may be of avail:

     "OF THE MANNER OF LIVING OF THE PEOPLE OF THE SAID LAND, AND OF
     CERTAIN CONDITIONS, BELIEF, AND MANNER OF MAKING WHAT THEY HAVE

"The said people have not any belief in God which may avail, for they
believe in one whom they call Cudouagny, and they say that he speaks
frequently to them and tells them what the weather should be. They say
also that when he is angry with them he throws dirt in their eyes.
They believe also that when they depart they go to the stars, then
go declining to the horizon like the said stars, then pass into fair
fields toward plains of beautiful trees, flowers and sumptuous fruits.
After they had given us to understand these things we showed them their
error and said that their Cudouagny is an evil spirit who abuses them,
and said that there is only one God, who is in heaven, who gives us all
things necessary, and is the Creator of all things, and that in Him
only should we believe, and that it was necessary to be baptised or
go to hell. Many other things of our faith were shown them which they
readily believed, and called their Cudouagny, Agojuda, so that many
times they prayed our captain to have them baptised. And the said Lord
Taignoagny, Dom Agaya, and all the people of their town, came there for
the purpose of being baptised; but because we knew not their intention
and sincerity and that there was none that could show them the faith
there, excuse was made to them, and it was told Taignoagny and Dom
Agaya that they should make them understand that we should return
another voyage, and would bring priests and holy oil, giving them
to understand for excuse that one could not be baptised without the
said holy oil, which they believed because they saw several children
baptised in Brittany, and of the promise that the captain made them to
return they were very joyous and thanked him.

"The said people live in almost a community of goods, rather of the
style of the Brazilians, and are wholly clothed with skin of wild
beasts, and poorly enough. In winter they are shod with stockings and
shoes, and in summer they go barefoot. They keep the order of marriage,
save that they take two or three wives, and after the husband is dead
the wives never remarry, but wear mourning for the said dead all
their lives, and besmear their faces with coal-dust and with grease
as thick as the thickness of a knife; and by that one knows that they
are widows. They have another custom very bad for their girls; for
after they are of age to marry they are all put into a common house,
abandoned to everybody who desires them until they have found their
match. And all this we have seen by experience, for we have seen the
houses as full of the said girls as is a school of boys in France.
And, moreover, gaming according to their manner is held in the said
houses, where they stake all that they have, even to the covering of
their nature. They do not any great work, and with little pieces of
wood about the size of a half-sword cultivate their land whereon they
raise their corn, which they call Zis, the which is as big as peas,
of the same grain in growth as in Brazil. Likewise they have a great
quantity of great melons, cucumbers, and pumpkins, peas and beans of
all colours, not of the kind of ours. They have also an herb of which
during the summer they make a great store for the winter, the which
they greatly esteem, and the men only use it in the manner following:
They have it dried in the sun and carry it about their necks in a
little beast's skin in place of a bag, with a horn of stone or wood;
then by and by they make powder of the said herb and put it in one of
the ends of the said horn, then put a coal fire thereon and suck at
the other end so long that they fill their bodies with smoke; insomuch
that it comes out by the mouth and nostrils as by a chimney funnel; and
they say that it keeps them healthy and warm, and they never go without
having their said things. We have tried the said smoke, which, after
being put into our mouths, seemed to be powder of pepper put therein,
it was so hot. The women of the said country work beyond comparison
more than the men, as well in fishing, of which they make a great
business, as in tilling and other things; and men, women and children
alike are more hardened to the cold than beasts, for with the greatest
cold that we may have seen, the which was extreme and bitter, they came
over the ice and snow every day to our ships, the most part of them
almost entirely naked, which is an incredible thing to one who has not
seen it. They take during the said ice and snow a great quantity of
wild beasts, as deer, stags, and bears, of which they brought us but
very little, because they were stingy of their victuals. They eat their
flesh wholly raw, after having been dried by the smoke, and likewise
their fish. By what we have seen and been able to learn of this said
people it seems to me that they might be easy to tame in such fashion
as one might desire. God by his divine compassion bestow upon them his
regard. Amen."


NOTE III--CANADA

Canada was limited by Cartier to the region between the Isle of Bacchus
(Isle d'Orleans) and Hochelaga. There can be no doubt that the word
Canada is derived from Cannata or Kannata, which in Iroquois signifies
a collection of dwellings, in other words a settlement, and it is
probable that when the Indians were asked by the French the name of
their country, they replied pointing to their dwellings, "Cannata,"
which their interrogators applied in a broader sense than was intended.


NOTE IV--GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF MOUNT ROYAL

The following geological study of Mount Royal prepared by Dean F. D.
Adams of McGill University for the Geological Survey Department of
the Federal Government cannot fail to be of interest to students of
Montreal:

"In the Province of Quebec, between the enormous expanse of the
Laurentian highlands to the northwest, constituting the 'Canadian
Shield,' and the disturbed and folded tract of country which marks
the Appalachian uplift, there is a great plain underlain by nearly
horizontal rocks of lower Palæozoic age. This plain, while really
showing slight differences of level from place to place, seems to the
casual observer perfectly flat. Its surface is mantled with a fertile
soil consisting of drift redistributed upon its surface by the sea,
which covered it at the close of the Glacial times. The uniform expanse
of this plain, however, is broken by several isolated hills composed of
igneous rocks, which rise abruptly from it and which constitute very
striking features of the landscape.

"From the top of Mount Royal the other hills referred to can all be
seen rising from the plain to the east; while to the north the plain
stretches away unbroken to the foot of the Laurentian plateau.

"The hills under consideration, while by no means 'mere hummocks,'
being situated in such a country of low relief, seem to be higher than
they really are and are always referred to locally as 'mountains.'

"These mountains, whose positions are shown on the accompanying map,
are eight in number, their names and their height above sea level being
as follows:

  "Mount Royal                     769.6 feet.
  Montarville or St. Bruno         715     "   (O'Neil)
  Beloeil                        1,437     "   (Leroy)
  Rougemont                      1,250     "
  Yamaska                        1,470     "   (Young)
  Shefford                       1,725     "
  Brome                          1,755     "
  Mount Johnson or Monnoir         875     "

"They have been called the Monteregian Hills from Mount Royal ('Mons
Regius'), which is the best known member of the group and may be taken
as their type.

"Brome Mountain is by far the largest member of the group, having an
area of 30 square miles. Shefford comes next in size, having an area of
rather less than nine square miles; while Mount Johnson, which is very
much smaller than any of the others, has an area of only .422 of one
square mile.

"Of these eight, the first six, as Logan notes, 'stand pretty nearly
in a straight line,' running approximately east and west, Mount Royal
being the most westerly, and the others following in the order in which
they are enumerated above, until Shefford Mountain, the most easterly
member of the series, is reached. Mount Johnson and Brome Mountain lie
on a line parallel to them, a short distance to the south, Rougemont
being the nearest neighbour to Mount Johnson and Brome Mountain
immediately south of Shefford. It is highly probable, in view of this
distribution, that these ancient volcanic mountains are, as is usual
in such occurrences, arranged along some line or lines of weakness or
deep-seated fracture. The 'pretty nearly straight line' referred to
by Logan, on which the first six mountains of the group are situated,
must be considered either as a single line with a rather sharp curve
in the middle or as made up of two shorter straight lines, each with
three mountains, diverging from one another at an angle of about thirty
degrees, with Montarville at the point of intersection. Mount Johnson
and Brome Mountain might then be considered as situated on short
subsidiary fractures.

"The distance from Brome Mountain, the most easterly member of the
Monteregian Hills, to Mount Royal the most westerly, is 50 miles
(80 km.). For a few miles to the east and west of these mountains
respectively, however, evidences of the igneous activity of the system
are manifested in the occurrence of occasional dykes or small stocks
of the consanguineous rocks of the series, the extreme easterly
representative of these being a little stock exposed about a mile and
a half east of Eastman, on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway,
and the most westerly being a series of dykes and a small stock at La
Trappe, on the Lake of Two Mountains. Similarly, the most northerly
extension is represented by a sheet intercalated between strata of the
Chazy limestone in the bed of the Little River, near St. Lin, 15 miles
(24 km.) north of St. Lin Junction. It is difficult to say just how far
to the south the last evidences of the Monteregian activity are found,
but scattered dykes of bostonite, camptonite and monchiquite have been
described by Kemp and Marsters from the shores of Lake Champlain (out
of which flows the River Richelieu), to a distance of 90 miles (145
km.) or more south of Mount Johnson.

"The Monteregian Hills are a series of ancient plutonic intrusions.
Some of them (e. g. Brome Mountain) are apparently denuded laccoliths,
one of them (Mount Johnson) is a typical neck or pipe, and it is
probable that some, if not all, of them, represent the substructures of
volcanoes which at one time were in active eruption in this region.

"It is impossible to determine accurately the date of these intrusions.
In the case of Mount Royal, however, inclusions of Lower Devonian
limestone are found in the intruded rock, so that the intrusions
forming the mountain are later than Lower Devonian time.

"Since Dresser by another line of evidence, has shown that the
intrusion of Mount Shefford probably took place before late
Carboniferous time, the Monteregian intrusions probably date back to
the late Devonian or early Carboniferous period.

"It must be noted that while six of these mountains rise from the
horizontal strata of the plain, the two most easterly members of the
group, namely Shefford and Brome, while still to the west of the axis
of that range, lie well within the folded belt of the Appalachians,
although, owing to the extensive denudation from which the region
has suffered, this folding has had but little influence on the local
topography. About La Trappe, at the extreme westerly extension of the
Monteregian area, the dykes of the series cut rocks of Laurentian age,
which here form an outlier of the great Laurentian protaxis on the
north.

"The Monteregian Hills form an exceptionally distinct and well marked
petrographical province, being composed of consanguineous rocks of very
interesting and rather unusual type. These are characterized by a high
content of alkali and in the main intrusion of almost every mountain
two distinct types are found associated with one another, representing
the products of the differentiation of the original magma.

     "These are--

     "(a) Nepheline syenite, in some cases replaced by or associated
     with pulaskite, tawite, akerite or nordmarkite.

     "(b) Essexite, in some cases represented by theralite, yamaskite,
     rougemonite, or rouvillite.

"It may be mentioned that yamaskite is a very basic rock type
characterized by a great predominance of pyroxene, basaltic hornblende
and ilmenite, with about two per cent of anorthite. Rougemonite
consists largely of anorthite with pyroxene as the only important
ferro-magnesian constituent. Rouvillite is a highly feldspathic variety
of theralite.


GEOLOGY OF MOUNT ROYAL

"Mount Royal consists of a body of intrusive plutonic rock penetrating
the nearly horizontal limestone of the Trenton formation (Ordovician).
It consists of two main intrusions composed of essexite and nepheline
syenite respectively, of which the nepheline syenite is the later
followed by a swarm of dykes and sheets of consanguineous rocks which
cut not only the main intrusions, but also penetrate the surrounding
limestones in all directions. The intrusive rock in some places tilts
up the limestones while elsewhere about the mountain these maintain
their horizontal attitude. The intrusion may be essentially laccolitic
in character, or it may represent the plutonic basis of a volcano. The
erosion has been so long continued that it has been impossible as yet
to reach a definite conclusion on this point.

"The greater part of the plain through which the mountain rises, and
which is underlaid by Ordovician strata, is mantled by drift which also
covers the slopes of the mountain. This drift, and in some places the
underlying rock, has been terraced by a series of well defined beaches,
which mark the successive stages of the retreat of the sea at the close
of the Glacial age.

"The City of Montreal is built upon these drift deposits, and lies
upon the slopes of Mount Royal and upon the plain about its foot. The
development of the city was largely influenced by the position of the
main beaches above mentioned.

"At a number of places on the slopes of Mount Royal and in its vicinity
there are remarkable developments of igneous breccia. This has as a
matrix one or other of the dyke rocks of the series, while the included
fragments consist in part of the Trenton limestone, often associated
with fragments of the other underlying stratified rocks traversed by
the dykes in their upward passage. These fragments are frequently so
numerous that they constitute a large part of the whole mass. Perhaps
the most remarkable of these breccias is that which occurs on St.
Helen's Island in the harbor of Montreal, and which is unique among
these occurrences in that it contains fragments of rocks which are
more recent in age than any of the sedimentary strata now found in the
district.

"At the present time a tunnel, about three and a half miles in
length, is being driven through Mount Royal by the Canadian Northern
Railway, in order to gain an entrance from the westward to their
proposed terminals in the vicinity of the corner of Dorchester and Ste.
Monique streets, in the City of Montreal. It has afforded an excellent
opportunity of studying the distribution of dykes, sheets, etc., as
well as fresher specimens of many of the rock types of the district.
Already about two miles and a half of the sub-heading have been driven.
More minute description, in detail, of the various explored strata of
rock is to be found in the same work."

As the origin of Montreal is bound up so closely with the history of
the colonization of La Nouvelle France, it is well to place it in
relation with this movement, otherwise Montreal will appear as detached
from its mission in the growth and development of Canada.

The date usually assigned for the discovery of Canada is April 5,
1409, but the knowledge of Canada begins only with Jacques Cartier.
Long, however, before him, the fishing grounds of Newfoundland had
seen navigators from Dieppe, St. Malo, La Rochelle, Honfleur and other
ports of France, besides those of Cornwall, Devonshire and the Channel
Islands. Brave mariners, Normands, Bretons and Basques, besides being
familiar with Newfoundland, knew vaguely of the existence of Canada,
although that name had not been yet attached to this country. Other
nations also were represented in these fishing regions, but it was
reserved to Cartier definitely to discover it, and to Francis I of
France, to attempt to colonize and christianize it.

It must be conceded that the religious policy played a great part, as
the commissions granted to Cartier, Champlain, and others, as well
as the report of these and the relations of their discoveries, amply
testify. Lescarbot, no good Catholic, acknowledges that: "Our kings in
enterprising these movements for discovery, have had another end than
that of our neighbours (the English and the Dutch). For I see by their
commissions that these smack only of the advancement of the Christian
religion without any present profit."

It is this lofty missionary spirit that we must read into the
adventurous motives of the first discoverers and founders of Canada--La
Nouvelle France--of Quebec and Montreal in particular, else nothing
but a sordid desire for trade, mixed perhaps with adventure, is to be
the story of the origin of our great country. Unless the religious
character and close touch with the supernatural, possessed by the first
inhabitants are appreciated, the romance of the accounts of the early
historians will have no attraction for our readers nor will the key to
the understanding of the history of Canada till the occupation by the
British in 1760 be supplied.

We must look upon Jacques Cartier, when as the bearer of a Royal
Commission, he left St. Malo, on April 20, 1534, to conquer new lands
for Christianity, as dignified by this side of his duty--to promote
the glory of God and that of France. Consequently his progress up the
River St. Lawrence to Hochelaga is marked by such incidents as the
distribution of rosaries and pious objects, emblems of the faith he
believed in, and the planting at Gaspé of a cross thirty feet high, in
the middle of which was a shield with three _fleurs de lis_, with the
inscription, cut into the wood, "Vive Le Roi de France." His course
and that of Champlain, up the St. Lawrence is strewn with a number
of places named after the festivals of the church, all dignifying an
otherwise prosaic catalogue of discoveries. The cross and the crown of
France may therefore be considered the emblems of the French occupation.

It is not the purpose of this book to detail Cartier's voyages, three
of which we have recounted by himself, those of 1534, 1535-36, and
1540. We have, however, chosen several extracts from the second voyage,
as these relate especially to Montreal. We wish to gather the results
of his work. He left no permanent settlement and established no trading
posts but he claimed the land for France and his accounts to the king
and the ministers and his published voyages of the country of Canada,
Hochelaga and Saguenay, kept before his countrymen the existence of a
great land in the West worth the colonizing.

Cartier's commission in the first voyage was that of "Captain and
Master Pilot of the King;" in the second, "Captain General and Master
Pilot." When he was sent on his third voyage, a new element entered
into the view of Canada. At the head of the expedition was placed a
gentleman of Picardy, Jean François de la Rocque Seigneur de Roberval,
whom Francis I playfully styled the Petty King of Vimeux, and whom he
appointed his lieutenant and governor in the countries of Canada and
Hochelaga, with Jacques Cartier as "the Captain General and leader of
the ships." His commission is dated October 20, 1540. This was to be
the first colonizing movement.

Jean François de la Rocque's letters patent were granted by Francis
I, on January 15, 1540. It reads, having learnt of the discovery
of countries, "the which have been found furnished with very good
commodities, and the people thereof well formed in body and limb and
well disposed in disposition and understanding, of which have also
been brought us others having the appearance of good inclination. In
consideration of which things we have considered and determined to
send again into the same countries of Canada and Hochelaga and others
circumjacent, as well as into all transmarine and maritime countries
inhabited, not possessed nor granted, by any Christian princes, some
goodly number of gentlemen, our subjects, as well men of war as common
people of each sex, and other craftsmen and mechanics in order to
enter further into the said countries; and as far as into the land of
the Saguenay and all other countries aforesaid, for the purpose of
discoursing with the said peoples therein, if it can be done, and to
dwell in the said lands and countries, there to construct and build
towns and forts, temples and churches in the communication of our Holy
Catholic Faith and Christian doctrine, to constitute and establish
laws in our name, together with officers of justice to make them live
according to equity and order and in the fear and love of God, to the
end that they may better conform to our purpose and do the things
agreeable to God, our Creator, Saviour and Redeemer, which may be to
the sanctification of His Holy Name and to the increase of our Holy
Faith and the growth of our Mother of the Holy Catholic Church, of the
which we are said to be and entitled the first son," etc.

The text of the letters patent following is a very long one, it enters
most minutely, and in a most legal and formal manner, into the details
of the powers of the governor which are to be very great and foresee a
thoroughly organized kingdom with all the elements of feudalism with
his fiefs and seigneuries--in fact a Nouvelle France!

On January 15th, Roberval's Royal Commission empowering him to take
the means for the equipment, was signed at Fontainebleau. It gave to
"our said lieutenant full authority, charge, commission and special
mandate to provide and furnish of himself all things necessary to
said army and to levy or cause to be levied in all parts, places and
precincts of our realm as shall seem to him good, paying therefor
reasonably, and as is meet, and to take men of war, or artisans and
others of divers conditions in order to carry them with him on the said
voyage, provided that this may be of their own good will and accord,
and likewise also provisions, victuals, arms, artillery, arquebuses,
powder, saltpeter, pikes and other offensive and defensive weapons, and
generally all clothing, instruments and other things suitable for the
equipment, despatch and efficiency of this army," etc. The supply of
volunteers for this expedition does not seem to have been sufficiently
encouraging, for, dated February 7th, we have an order by Francis I,
for delivery of prisoners to Jehan François de la Rocque. This document
after re-stating the terms of the commissions, already given, in view
of the wish of the King that the expedition shall sail on the 15th
of April, at the latest, states "and on account of the long distance
from the said country and the fear of shipwreck and maritime risks,
and others regretting to leave their goods, relatives and friends,
fearing to make the said voyage; and, peradventure as a number, who
would willingly make the same journey, might object to remain in the
same country after the return of our said lieutenant, by means of
which, through want of having a competent number of men for service,
and other volunteers to people the said countries, the undertaking of
the said voyage could not be accomplished so soon, and as we desire,
and as it is requisite for the weal of the human creatures dwelling
in the said country without law and without knowledge of God and of
his holy faith, which we wish to increase and augment by a great zeal,
a thing if it were not accomplished, which would cause us very great
regret, considering the great benefit and public weal which would
proceed from the said enterprise, and as we have enjoined and verbally
commanded our said lieutenant to diligently execute our said will and
intention, to depart and commence the said voyage by the fifteenth of
April next ensuing, at farthest if it can be accomplished," etc. * * *
"We desire to employ clemency, in doing a good and meritorious work,
towards some criminals and malefactors, that by this they may recognize
the Creator by rendering him thanks and amending their lives, we have
thought proper to have given and delivered to our said lieutenant,
his clerks and deputies, to the full number that he shall advise of
the said criminals and malefactors detained in the jails and state
prisons of our parliament and of other jurisdictions, * * * such as
they shall desire to choose and select, condemned and judged as has
been said, always excepting the imprisoned criminals to whom we are not
accustomed to give pardon * * * commuting the penalty of death into an
honest and useful voyage, with the condition that when the said persons
return home again from the said voyage without permission from us, they
shall be executed in the place in which they may have been condemned,
immediately and without hope of pardon."

An extract from the Parliament Registers at Rouen of March 9th, giving
power to Roberval to have the prisoners transferred from its jails to
him limits the choice somewhat by "excepting the prisoners who shall
be held in cases and crimes of heresy and high treason in the first
degree, of counterfeiting money and other too monstrous cases and
crimes."

Roberval could not get his party together for April. Indeed it seemed
that he needed Jacques Cartier's assistance, for on October 17, 1540,
we find him receiving a commission similar to Roberval's to take over
fifty prisoners. In this charge he is allowed and permitted "to take
the little galleon, called L'Emerillon which he now has of us, the
which is already old and rotten, in order to serve in repairing those
of the ships which shall have need of it," without rendering any
account of it. But it was not till May 23d of the year following, 1541,
that Cartier set sail with five ships, well furnished and victualed
for two years. He went without Roberval, because as the King had sent
Cartier letters "whereby he did expressly charge him to depart and
set sail immediately upon the sight and receipt thereof, on pain of
incurring his displeasure, and as Roberval had not got his artillery,
powder and ammunitions ready he told Cartier to go on ahead and he
would prepare a ship or two at Honfleur whither he expected his things
were to come. Having mustered and reviewed "the gentleman soldiers and
mariners which were retained and chosen for the performance of the said
voyage, he gave unto Captain Cartier full authority to depart and go
before and to govern all things as if he had been there in person."

So Cartier sailed away, on May 23d. We will leave the misfortunes on
the way to be read in Cartier's memoir of the third voyage. At last,
however, Cartier arrived at the mouth of what is now Cape Rouge River
and found a spot where a fort should be built on the high point now
called Redclyffe. This fort he called Charlesbourg Royal, doubtless
after Charles, Duke of Orléans, son of Francis I. He put three of the
vessels in haven, and after the two others were emptied of all that
was destined for the colony, Cartier sent them back and with them
in command Marc Jalobert, his brother-in-law, and Etienne Noël, his
nephew, to tell King Francis that they had begun to construct a fort,
but that Monsieur de Roberval was not yet come and that he feared
that by occasion of contrary winds and tempests he was driven back to
France. They departed for St. Malo on September 2d.

Things were progressing at the fort; the land was tilled and the fort
was begun to be built; but now a party consisting of Cartier, Martin
de Painport, with other gentlemen, and the remnant of the mariners,
departed with two boats "with victuals to go as far as Hochelaga of
purpose to view and understand the fashion of the Saults of water."
The Viscount de Beaupré stayed behind for the guarding and government
of all things in the fort. Cartier's party reached the rapids passing
Tutonaguy, which we identify as the site of Montreal, but we have no
record of his staying there. Cartier's memoirs of the voyage break off
here. However, as we are interested only in the colonizing movement,
we get sufficient information from Roberval's account of his voyage of
the fate of the Charlesbourg attempt. Roberval says that Cartier left
for France at the end of September, 1541, and that he himself after
having set sail from Honfleur, on the 16th of April, 1542, arrived at
Newfoundland on the 7th of June following, where he found Cartier on
his way home. Cartier explained that he had left the fort because he
had not been able, with his little troupe, to resist the savages who
roamed daily around the fort, and were very harassing. However, Cartier
and his men praised the country highly, as being very rich and fertile,
adding that they had taken away many diamonds, and a certain quantity
of gold ore which Roberval examined and found good. Roberval had
arrived with three great vessels fitted out at the expense of the King,
with 200 souls, men and women and some gentlemen, among them being the
Sieur de Lenneterre, his lieutenant, Lespinay, his ensign, the Captain
Guinecourt, and the pilot, Jean Alphonse. He ordered Cartier to retrace
his steps to Charlesbourg, believing that the new recruitment was able
to resist the attacks of the enemy. But Cartier, and his following,
departed secretly the following night. Whether or not this flight was
disloyal, or born of fear, or of vainglory, since Roberval asserted,
that Cartier had fled being desirous of getting first to France to
acquaint the king of his discoveries, certain it is that it was wise.
For this first royal colonizing party composed of so many men and women
from the jails of France was fated to be a most lamentable failure.
Famine and lawlessness marked its sojourn at Charlesbourg. It was well
that New France should not be born of such material for citizenship.
This voyage has an interest for Montrealers in that Roberval passed by
it on a voyage to the Sault.

Cartier never seems to have been blamed by the king for his desertion
of Roberval, but, it is said, he was sent back to recall him for more
useful service in France. Of this fourth voyage of Jacques Cartier
we have no record. We find him settled in France, ennobled and known
as the Sieur de Limoilou, although there is a tradition, not well
founded, that he made a fifth voyage to Canada. He lived an honoured
man in St. Malo to his death. In the margin of the old record of the
Town of St. Malo under date of September 1, 1557, we find the following:

     "This said Wednesday about five o'clock in the morning died
     Jacques Cartier."

Cartier's name is no longer to be associated with the further history
of Canada, except in the memory of a grateful people, who will come to
admire the memory of this brave sailor, daring adventurer, missionary
and historian--the discoverer of Canada and Montreal. We shall see,
however, how this spirit of enterprise for Canadian extension was
carried on by his nephews.

We cannot help feeling sorry for Roberval. He was a young man of
energy and had great ideas as a colonizer. He went out, according to
Charlevoix, with the Royal Commission as "Lord of Norumberga, Viceroy
and Lieutenant General of Canada, Hochelaga, Saguenay, Newfoundland,
Belle-Isle, Carpunt, Labrador, the Great Bay and Baccalaos." He was
recalled for more useful service!

After Cartier had ceased visiting the St. Lawrence, the care of the
French government for the development and colonization of Canada seems
to have been neglected from 1543 to 1603. Cartier's discoveries were
not appreciated; it was reserved for Champlain three-quarters of a
century later, to follow in his footsteps. As Champlain is the trader
_par excellence_ of Canada and of Montreal, we may now briefly trace
the history of our trade.

Although discovery and colonization were so long abandoned still the
banks of Newfoundland and the mouth of the St. Lawrence were frequented
yearly by hardy Normans and Bretons as before, for the cod and whale
fishery there.[21] Trading with the natives in peltry became insensibly
mingled with the occupation of fisherman and Tadoussac grew to be a
public market for this sort of commerce and exchange. There we would
have found many good friends of Jacques Cartier, among them Capt. Marc
Jalobert, his brother-in-law, who visited Hochelaga in 1535 and Etienne
Noël, his nephew, also a sturdy captain under Cartier in his third
voyage. There, too, would have been Jacques Noël, his great-nephew,
who reports in a letter of 1557 that he had gone on his uncle's
traces up the St. Lawrence as far as the Great Sault. This visit to
Hochelaga makes us interested in him, the more so, as it was this Noël,
associated with Sieur de la Jaunaye-Chaton and the nephew of Jacques
Cartier, who in 1558 applied to Henry III for a charter similar to that
granted by Francis I to their uncle, appealing for this favour on the
ground that their uncle had spent, from his own pocket in the service
of the king in the voyage of 1541, a sum in excess of that which he had
received from the king, and had been allowed no recompense; nor had
indeed his heirs. Warned by the failures and the expenses of the past
the King demurred. Cartier's nephew then compromised. They offered to
renew their uncle's design and to form a French colony in Canada to
Christianize the savages, all at their own expense, provided that the
king would grant them the sole privilege for twelve years of trading
with the inhabitants, principally in peltry and that he would forbid
interference of rivals with them in this privilege and in the
exploitation of a mine discovered by them. To this the King consented
by a favour of January 14, 1588. This monopoly, the first of its kind,
was soon revoked at the instance of jealous rival traders of St. Malo
who obtained a revocation of the charter on the 5th of May following
for they considered that the good things coming from Jacques Cartier's
discoveries were to be shared in by all of St. Malo, since they
belonged to all and not to his nephews alone.

This attempt to obtain a private monopoly having failed, we are
surprised to find a monopoly being granted in 1589 by Henry IV to a
gentleman of Brittany, the Sieur de la Roche, apparently in accordance
with a promise given verbally or otherwise by Henry III at sometime
before his assassination in August, 1659. This document was one similar
to that granted by Francis I to Roberval and it made de la Roche
the king's lieutenant governor in New France--with real vice-regal
privileges. The commission differed in this from Roberval's that it
gave power to the lieutenant general to choose merchants to accompany
him and forbade all others to trade in the same regions without his
consent under penalty of confiscation of merchandise and vessels.
Again a miserable fiasco was to take place. The lieutenant governor
had to draw upon the jails and galleys for his colonists. He arrived
with sixty men under the direction of pilot Chedotel at Sable Island,
twenty-five leagues to the south of the Island of Cape Breton. Arrived
there he disembarked, according to Lescarbot, the greater part of those
he had drawn from the prisons, left them provisions and merchandise,
and promised to return for them as soon as he had found on the
mainland, a suitable place for settlement. Taking a little bark, he
went to the Acadian coast, but on returning was surprised by so violent
a wind that he was driven back to France in less than twelve days. The
fate of the abandoned colonists had better be told by Champlain. In
the description of his voyages, dedicated to Cardinal Richelieu and
published in 1632, Champlain's criticism of de la Roche's expedition
was "that the fault of this attempt at colonizing was that this
marquis did not have some one experienced in such matters explore and
reconnoitre, before assuming so excessive an outlay." On the other hand
we can be glad that Canada did not start her origin as a colony with
such stuff as composed the greater part of Roberval's and de la Roche's
consignments.

In 1598 the Edict of Nantes had been published in France and it was
soon to affect Canada in this wise. In France it had restored civil and
religious liberty to the Huguenots, Protestants or French Calvinists.
The spirit of conciliation was in the air and Huguenots now began to
take their place in the judicature and financial posts, and in the
army. Next year we find a sailor merchant of St. Malo named Dupont
Gravé soliciting a commission for Sieur Chauvin, of Normandy, a
Huguenot, a man of great skill and experience in navigation, captain
in the King's navy and of some influence at the court. As the King
remembered the good services of M. Chauvin he granted a monopoly to
him on the condition that no one should trade in Canada unless he had
Chauvin's permission and should settle in the country and make a home
there. Chauvin was to bear all the expenses, and he was to take 500 men
to fortify the country and defend it, and to teach the Catholic faith
to the Indians.

Tadoussac was chosen as the headquarters. Thither Chauvin and Dupont
Gravé and a Huguenot, Pierre Dugas, Sieur de Monts, a prospector who
came out on "pleasure," went with an advance party. Tadoussac had
been well enough for a summer trading post but, says Champlain, "if
there is an ounce of cold forty leagues up the river there is a pound
at Tadoussac." However, they fixed up a guardlike building of wood, 25
feet long by 18 wide, and 8 feet high. This was to harbour seventeen
men and provisions. "Behold them there very warm for the winter,"
chuckles Champlain, who had no love for the Huguenots. The leaders went
to France and during the winter the settlement at Tadoussac was "the
Court of King Pétaud; each one wished to command. Laziness, idleness,
and the diseases that attacked those remaining, reduced them to great
want and obliged them to give themselves up to the savages, who kindly
harboured them and they left their lodging. Some died miserably; others
suffered a great deal while waiting for the return of the ships." In
the next year a second voyage as fruitless as the first was made, by
Chauvin. He assayed another but fell into an illness which sent him to
another world. We have Champlain's comment in the account published
in 1632 on this attempt at colonization. "The trouble with this
undertaking was giving to a man of opposing religion a commission to
establish a nursery for the Catholic Apostolic and Roman faith[22] of
which the heretics have such a horror and abomination. These are the
defects that must be mentioned in regard to the enterprise."

After the death of Chauvin, the same commission of lieutenant general
was applied for, by Eymard de Chastes, Knight of Malta, Commander of
Lormetan, Grand Master of the Order of St. Lazarus and Governor of
Dieppe. Henry IV granted it and de Chaste should have made a good
colonizer for he intimated that in making his application it was in the
intention of betaking himself thither in person and of devoting the
rest of his years to the service of God and that of his king, but he
was not to live long. In order to meet the expenses of the expedition
Commander de Chastes formed a company of several of the principal
merchants of Rouen and elsewhere. He chose the explorer, Dupont Gravé,
to direct the flotilla as before to Tadoussac, and he desired him to
associate with himself in his further explorations for which he had
received a commission from the king, a young captain of Saintonge,
who had already given undoubted proof of his ability as a zealous,
courageous and intelligent explorer.

This was none other than Samuel de Champlain, whose name is to be
connected this very year of 1603 with Montreal and more lastingly in
1611. He is to become entitled to be called the founder of La Nouvelle
France. De Champlain had been living at Dieppe after his return from
a visit of two years to the West Indies and New Spain, for which he
had started early in 1599 in command of a French ship chartered by the
Spanish authorities and in which he had sailed under his uncle, a man
of distinction, in the previous year. During this period he had the
opportunity of observing and studying a European colony before trying
to found one himself. His "_Brief discours des choses plus remarquables
que Samuel Champlain de Brouage a reconnues aux Indes Occidentales, au
voyage qu' il y a fait_," was the result of this experience.

Champlain was now thirty-six years of age, having been born about the
year 1567 at Brouage, a small seaport town in the old province of
Saintonge, southeast of Rochefort and opposite the island of Oléron.
Champlain's father was a sailor, being a captain of the marine; his
uncle's position we have seen. Hence we do not wonder, when he tells
us of himself: "From my earliest years the art of navigation attracted
me, made me love the sea and drove me to expose myself nearly all
my life to the wild waves of the ocean. It has made me explore the
coasts of a part of the lands of America, and principally those of 'La
Nouvelle France,' where I have always had the desire to cause the lily
to flourish with the only Catholic religion, Apostolic and Roman." But
Champlain was also a soldier, for, having taken up the cause of Henry
IV in the troublous times of the League, he had served in Brittany
under Maréchals de Daumont de St. Luc and de Brissac and held during
several years the rank of Maréchal de Logis in the royal army. He held
this position till May 2, 1598, when peace between France and Spain
was established by the treaty of Vervins. Then again he turned to the
sea and went with his uncle to Spain, and afterward to Spanish America
as we have said. On his return he seems to be in favour with, and in
the service of, the King. He is in receipt of a pension, either for
his services in the army, or, as it has been supposed, because the
King, having been shown the notes and topographical sketches taken
by Champlain in his late voyage, had given him the title of Royal
Geographer; but when Commander de Chastes, who doubtless also had seen
the manuscripts, offered him a post in his new expedition, Champlain
told him he must obtain the king's permission for him to embark as
indeed de Chastes did. Moreover, the king commissioned Champlain to
report faithfully on his discoveries.

So Dupont Gravé and Champlain set out for Tadoussac and on the 18th of
June, reaching it, made for the Grand Sault. They passed by Quebec,
"which is a strait of the River of Canada, and anchored till Monday,
June 28th, and thence proceeding examined and named Three Rivers and
found it good for a future settlement." Finally on Wednesday, July 2,
the feast of the Visitation, they reached the entrance of the Sault. We
will reserve this visit to its proper chapter. After their exploration
on July 4th they turned back to Tadoussac and thence to France, where
they learned of the death of the worthy Commander de Chastes at Dieppe
on Tuesday, May 13, 1603. To replace de Chastes, that same Sieur de
Monts, who prospected Tadoussac with Chauvin, now took command of the
reins of government as lieutenant general, having applied for a similar
charter as the last. He was a Huguenot and was Governor of Paris for
the Protestant party. He continued the same association, employing
Dupont Gravé and Champlain. With them was the gentleman adventurer, the
Sieur de Poutrincourt. They set sail from Havre on the 7th of March,
1604, this time for Acadia. A site, since called "Port Royal," was
chosen by Poutrincourt and granted on condition he should return.

After having abandoned Acadia in 1607, de Monts now turned his
attention to Canada. He did this the more readily because the king
gave him for one year the exclusive right of the fur trade. Champlain,
hitherto a man subordinate, was charged by the lieutenant general as
his lieutenant. Champlain sailed from France on the 13th of April,
arrived at Tadoussac on the 3d of June and ascending the St. Lawrence,
named Cape Tourment and Montmorency Falls and, reaching Stadaconé,
he chose that place called Kébec by the natives and began to take
possession of it in the name of M. de Monts, and to construct a fort.
Champlain's instinct as a city planner was distinctly manifested
in the choice of the bold promontory whose bases are washed by the
Rivers St. Lawrence, Cap Rouge and St. Charles and whose outlook from
the promontory above is one of the grandest in the world. There were
twenty-eight men sent by de Monts for the expedition. A plot having
arisen among these to kill Champlain, one of the conspirators was
beheaded and three others were sent back to France. Soon, also, some
twenty died of scurvy or of dysentery caused by the eating of eels to
excess. The colony was now a cipher. Meanwhile, in France, de Monts'
one year's monopoly was revoked owing to the jealousy of the merchants
there. The question of the sale of the habitation of Quebec came up,
as the post appeared to be unnecessary if there was to be no monopoly.
Sieur de Monts remained governor general. Seeing the danger of de
Monts' enterprise breaking up, through the trading with the savages
being thrown open to other traders, Champlain began to look out for
himself and to cast his eyes on the Great Sault as a trading post for
himself. Thither he now went, as shall be related hereafter.

About this time, as the prohibition of trading had been removed from
private individuals, the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the river was a scene
of rival barks of greedy, avaricious, envious people without harmony
and without chief. On his return to France as de Monts wished to
resign his command, Champlain went to court to get permission to form
a company with exclusive rights and he was advised to invite Charles
de Bourbon, Count of Soissons, to accept the governor generalship on
the ground that his powerful protectorate would control order among
the traders in Canadian waters. This was accepted, and after the
necessary documents had been made out, but before being published,
the count died. The Prince de Condé, Henri de Bourbon, then accepting
the protectorate, received his commission, and named Samuel de
Champlain his lieutenant. But the commission was not published, owing
to representations being made to the Prince de Condé that such an
association was prejudicial to trade. The delay was doubtless annoying
to Champlain. However, as the old company was not yet dissolved,
Champlain, not wishing to lose the fur trade for the current year, ran
off again to Canada. On his return to France he went to Fontainebleau,
where the King and the Prince of Condé were.

Champlain was now successful as a company promoter. He contrived to get
his opposing merchants to come into the scheme themselves, and form a
company, of which they made him the managing director in Canada, with
a yearly salary of two hundred écus for looking after their interests.
The Prince of Condé became the governor general and the commission gave
a monopoly for eleven years. The usual powers were given as we have
seen before of absolute power, the proviso of bringing the savages
to the light of the Holy Roman and Catholic and Apostolic religion
being included as usual. This seems strange considering that all the
merchants of the new company were Huguenot Protestants.

On arriving in Canada Champlain soon made his first great mistake. He
was about to commence the great work of colonization of La Nouvelle
France, in which he was to succeed, but his first important step was
a great blunder and one from which La Nouvelle France was to suffer
for many years. The whole story of the Iroquois attacks, which
terrorized the French settlements and Montreal for so many years, is
bound up in the policy now initiated by the colonial builder of Canada.
It will be remembered that in the commissions granted to those sent
out to Canada, side by side with the duty of taking every means to
attract the natives to Christianity, was the privilege to contract
alliances with the natives and if they did not keep their treaties to
force them by open warfare, and to make peace or war--but all this,
be it understood, in accordance with the dignity of a great power and
following established methods of diplomacy. Champlain's fault lies
in this, that having arrived in Canada in the spring of 1605 as the
representative of the king of France, he was tempted, for the sake of
the petty reason of securing traffic facilities, to jeopardize the
future by taking sides with the Algonquins and Hurons, who were then in
open warfare with the Iroquois. Instead of remembering that the future
peace of the colony depended on his neutrality, he went with the few
men of the colony against the Iroquois, and with his modern weapons
caused deadly havoc among the bewildered Iroquois, who thenceforth
became the irreconcilable enemy of the Frenchmen. They never forgot
this needless intrusion of the Frenchmen into their quarrels; thus
they were implacable in their attacks on their Algonquin allies, and
were ready later to ally themselves with the English in their campaign
against the colony. It certainly made the work of Christianizing and
civilizing the people later very difficult. Champlain's blunder at
the battle of Lake Champlain on July 29, 1609, has been avoided in
subsequent colonization schemes of other nations as far as possible.
This is one of the uses of history.

[Illustration: CHAMPLAIN'S PICTURE OF HIS FIGHT WITH THE IROQUOIS]

So far we have seen that the two chief conditions, on which the trading
companies were granted their monopolies, were those of taking steps to
colonize and to Christianize. Neither had been observed. The merchants
were there for business and nothing else. Be it said, however, to
Champlain's credit that he was more ready than any of the others to
carry out both conditions. In 1615 he secured the four Recollect
Fathers of whom we shall speak. Their memoirs reveal a pitiable state
of irreligion, and apathy towards the policy of French colonization and
Christianizing the natives. Thus in Quebec, in 1617, there were only
fifty to sixty Frenchmen, in 1620 only sixty men, women and children
and religious all told. There seems to have been only one family,
that of the colonist, Louis Hébert, and he had a sorry time to make
a living. Louis Hébert was an apothecary and thus he was useful to
be tolerated, by the merchants. Some day Hébert will have a monument
raised to Him to commemorate his efforts to commence agriculture in
Canada.

Towards the end of the year Champlain's blunder begins to have its
fruits, for the savages around Quebec determined to exterminate the
French settlement. In the sequel, they satisfied their vengeance
by killing only two secretly, but it was a sign of more to follow.
Meanwhile what were the gentlemen with the high sounding titles
of governor general and viceroy of the king doing to carry on the
wonderful scheme outlined in their commissions? They were like modern
titled directors of speculating companies, drawing their fees. Thus
the Prince of Condé drew 1,000 _écus_, then while he was in prison
his successor to the fees, the Maréchal de Thémines drew 5,000, to
be followed by 11,000 drawn by the Duke de Montmorency, a young man
of twenty-five years, appointed governor general in 1618. This was
a drain on the merchants. Still it was better than losing their
privileges.

The new governor general, Montmorency, appointed Champlain his
particular lieutenant. In fact, Champlain may be called the acting
governor. This looked at last like a real attempt to make a true
settlement. Champlain now brought Madame de Champlain out and others,
and with them Madame Champlain brought her furniture. The Recollect
Father, Denis Jamay, came back with two other Recollects. The day after
arrival at Quebec, after mass and a sermon in the chapel exhorting all
the colonists to obedience to the king, they all assembled and the
commission of His Majesty to Montmorency was read, as well as that of
Montmorency to Champlain as his lieutenant. The cannon spoke amid the
cries of "Vive le Roi" and Champlain took possession of the Habitation
in the name of the Duke of Montmorency. It became Government House.
Obliged by his commission to carry on justice, Champlain now looked out
for the most capable men in the country to act with him on the bench
of justice. The king's procuratorship fell to Louis Hébert, while the
office of _lieutenant de prevost_ was taken by Gilbert Coursera, and a
man named Nicholas became the clerk of the Court of Quebec. Champlain
took the direction of the "_police_."

Building activities were now taking place. The Recollects commenced
the foundations for a convent and a seminary, for the native children,
under the name of Notre Dame des Anges, the stone being laid by Father
Jean d'Olbeau on June 3d. Champlain began to build another habitation
on the hill which he named the Fort St. Louis. He also began tilling
the ground and making a garden, a work which he delighted in. He was
seconded in such enterprises by the Recollects. He next prepared to
receive cattle. But there were only forty-five people at the habitation
and the company was not sending more. In order to better things
Montmorency in 1621 formed another company opposed to that of which
M. de Monts was still head and he placed in command two Huguenots,
Guillaume de Caen and Emery de Caen, uncle and nephew. The new company
was opposed to the old but a union was effected between them: still
with no better results. In the beginning of 1625 Henri de Lévy, Duke
de Vantadour, a pious nobleman who afterwards became a religious,
succeeded his uncle, the Duke de Montmorency, as governor general.
Negotiations pending the introduction of Jesuits, on the request of the
Recollects, were now concluded. Accordingly he sent at his own expense
Fathers Lalement, Brébeuf, Massé and two lay brothers, who arrived
in the absence of Champlain and were coldly received by de Caen, who
offered them no hospitality. The Recollects, however, entertained them
at their convent, for two years and a half, until their own buildings
were ready. In 1627, a year of great famine, the above company was
supplanted by the famous Company of One Hundred Partners or Associates.

The name of Samuel de Champlain is next to be more closely associated
with Montreal. For, although the date connecting him with his first
visit to this site is 1603, and that of Cartier's visit in 1535,
Montreal had not been visited or dwelt upon by any distinguished
European that we can attach a name to, with any certainty.

During all this time, according to tradition, sad things had occurred
at Hochelaga.

"The fate of this Indian town," says Mr. Arthur Weir in "Montreal, the
Metropolis of Canada," "is shrouded in the mists of antiquity. There
is reason to believe that here was enacted a tragedy similar to that
which resulted in the destruction of Troy. According to Mr. Peter
Dooyentate Clarke, the historian of the Wyandots, himself a descendant
of the tribe, the Senecas and Wyandots, or Hurons, lived side by side
at Hochelaga, until in an evil moment a stern chief of the Senecas
refused to permit his son to marry a Huron maiden. The damsel thereupon
rejected all suitors and promised to marry only him who should kill the
chief who had thus offended her.

"A youthful Huron, more amorous than wise, fulfilled the terms of
the vow and won the girl. But the Senecas adopted the cause of their
murdered chief, and made war upon the Hurons, whom they almost
exterminated with the assistance of the other tribes of the Iroquois,
driving their more peaceful and civilized neighbours to the very lake
that now bears their name." However true or false this legend, it is
certain that when Champlain visited the island in 1603 the Indian town
was gone and desolation prevailed.

Another version of the same tradition is given by Mr. Bourinot, in
"The Story of Canada," where he tells the popular tradition handed
down by the Indians, "that the Hurons and Iroquois, branches of the
same family, speaking dialects of one common language, were living at
one time in villages, not far from each other,--the Hurons probably
at Hochelaga and the Senecas on the other side of the mountain. It
was against the law of the two communities for their men and women
to intermarry, but the potent influence of true love, so rare in an
Indian's bosom, soon broke this command. A Huron girl entered a cabin
of an Iroquois chief as his wife. It was an unhappy marriage, the
husband killed the wife in an angry moment. This was a serious matter,
requiring a council meeting of the two tribes. Murder must be avenged
or liberal compensation given to the friends of the dead. The council
decided that the woman deserved death, but the verdict did not please
all her relatives, one of whom went off secretly and killed an Iroquois
warrior. Then, both tribes took up the hatchet, and went on the warpath
against each other, with the result, that the Village of Hochelaga,
with all the women and children, was destroyed, and the Hurons, who
were probably beaten, left the St. Lawrence and eventually found a new
home on Lake Huron."--See Horatio Hale's "Fall of Hochelaga" in Journal
of American Folklore, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1894.

If Cartier was the discoverer of "Hochelaga," the Island of Montreal,
it is to Champlain's honour that he was the first trader and the first
designator of the site of the present City of Montreal. He was the
first city planner in that he saw the possibilities of Montreal as a
trading port, having all the attractions for a future settlement. It
had a beautiful mountain with gentle slopes to the river at its base,
and a natural harbour; it was the natural rendezvous of all the tribes
bordering on the river beyond the _saults_, the last of which is that
now known as the Lachine Rapids; it was the port for the fur trade
of the hinterland beyond. Both Cartier and Champlain also noted the
wonderful fertility of its soil and the beauty of its surroundings. As
then, so today, Montreal's position, placed at the head of Atlantic
navigation, the natural headquarters of the Gulf trade, that of the
St. Lawrence and of the Great Lakes, centre of attraction and terminus
of all the great railroads of the West and from the United States,
secures it an undoubted future as a great commercial centre. It is to
Champlain's credit that in his own day he realized the geographical
value of Montreal as a trading centre, indicated by the natural laws
for shipment and transportation, albeit he contemplated it only with
the limited vision of a fur trader whose clients were the savages from
the back country and their freight vessels, canoes laden with peltry.
He looked ahead.

[Illustration: The first trader at Montreal]

In July, 1603, Champlain reached the rapids of the sault above
Montreal. Champlain says that it used to be called Hochelaga but now
the Sault. When he reached it there was nothing of the old villages
left. Luckily Champlain was a cartographer and historian, and we have
the account of visits to Montreal which we now reproduce; but it must
be remembered that he always speaks of the site as "the Sault," "the
grand Sault," or "the Sault St. Louis."

The first quotations shall be from the account of his voyage in 1603.
This was published in 1604 in Paris under the title, "_Des Sauvages,
ou Voyage de Sammuel Champlain de Brouage faict en la France Nouvelle,
l'an mil six cens trois_." This was made into English and published in
"Purchas', His Pilgrimes," London, 1625.

"At length we came this very day to the entrance of the Sault or Fall
of the Great River of Canada with favourable wind; and we met with an
Ile, which is almost in the middest of the said entrance, which is a
quarter of a league long, and passed on the South side of the said Ile,
where there was not past three, four or five feet water, and sometimes
a fathome or two, and straight on the sudden we found again not past
three or foure foot. There are many Rockes and small islands, whereon
there is no wood, and they are even with the water. From the beginning
of the aforesaid Ile, which is in the middest of the entrance the
water beginneth to run with a great force. Although we had the wind
very good, yet we could not with all our might make any great way;
neuerthelesse wee passed the said Ile which is at the entrance of the
Sault or Fall. When wee perceived that we could go no further, we came
to an anchor on the North Shoare ouer against a small Iland, which
aboundeth for the most part with those kinds of fruits which I have
spoken of before. Without all delay we made ready our Skiffe which wee
had made of purpose to pass the said Sault: whereinto the said Monsieur
du Pont and my selfe entered with certaine Sauages, which we had
brought with vs to show vs the way. Departing from our Pinnace, we were
scarce gone three hundred paces, but we were forced to come out, and
caused certain mariners to free our Skiffe. The canoa of the Sauages
passed easily. Wee met with an infinite number of small Rockes, which
were euen with the water, on which we touched often times. There be
two great Ilands one on the North Side which containeth some fifteene
leagues in length, and almost as much in breadth, beginning some twelve
leagues vp within the River of Canada, going towards the River of the
Irocois and endeth beyond the Sault. The Iland which is on the South
Side is some four leagues long and some halfe league broad. There is
also another island which is neare to that on the North Side which may
bee some halfe a league long, and some quarter broad; and another small
iland which is between that on the North Side, and another nearer to
the South Shoare, whereby we passed the entrance of the Sault. This
entrance being passed, there is a kind of Lake, wherein all these
Ilands are, some five leagues long and almost as broad, wherein are
many small Ilands which are Rockes. There is a Mountaine neere the said
Sault which discovereth farre into the Countrie and a Little River
which falleth from the said Mountaine into the Lake. On the South
Side there are some three or foure Mountaines which seem to be about
fifteen or sixteen leagues within the Land. There are also two Rivers;
one which goeth to the first Lake of the River of the Irocois by which
sometimes the Algoumequins invade them: and another which is neer unto
the Sault, which runneth not farre into the countrey."

On this voyage he describes the Sault. Since he is later, in 1611, to
shoot it, we may record his impression of it in 1603. "At our coming
neere to the said Sault with our Skiffe and Canoa, I assure you, I
neuer saw any stream of water to fall down with such force as this
doth; although it be not very high, being not in some places past one
or two fathoms, and at the most three. It falleth as it were steppe by
steppe: and in euery place where it hath some small height, it maketh a
strong boyling with the force and strength of the running of the water.
In the breadth of the said Sault, which may containe some league, there
are many broad Rockes, and almost in the middest, there are very narrow
and long Ilands, where there is a fall as well on the side of the said
Iles which are toward the South, as on the North Side: where it is so
dangerous that it is not possible for any man to pass with any boat how
small so-euer it be."

In his voyage in 1603 he makes mention of an island of a quarter of a
league in length and of another on the north about fifteen leagues long
which overlooked the lands for a long distance. He does not mention
the name of either, but the former was St. Paul's island or Nuns'
island and the latter Hochelaga. Up to Champlain no one has recorded or
noticed that Montreal was an island.

As early as 1610 Lescarbot had remarked that of all the islands in
the River St. Lawrence, the most suitable for commerce was without
contradiction that of Montreal. ("La Conversion des Sauvages Baptisés
en Canada.")

Champlain certainly looked upon the locality of the Sault as a suitable
place for a permanent establishment, when he commenced operations at
Place Royale. He continued in this belief.

"My Savage Arontal," he says in his "Voyages of 1615-1616," published
in 1627, "being at Quebec that to attract his people to us we should
make a habitation at the Sault, which would give them the surety of
the passage of the river and would protect them against their enemies
and that as soon as we should have built a house, they would come in
numbers to live with us as brothers, a thing which I promised them and
answered them I would do as soon as possible."

There is reason to believe that the spot he had in mind to do this is
the island which he had noted in his voyage of 1603, but to which he
later gave the name of St. Helen.[23] This is most probable in view of
his late marriage five months before with Hélène Boullé, for it could
not have been given, as other names in the river had been, owing to
the coincidence of a church feast day with the day of discovery, for
Champlain arrived at Place Royale on the 28th of May and the feast of
St. Helen fell on the 18th of August following, when he was in France.

We know that Champlain had gone to the "Sault" in 1603, but he makes no
mention of the site of Montreal in his account. However, with regard to
the year of 1611, he gives us many interesting details.

From these excerpts from the account of 1603 we may, therefore, sum up
the following conclusions: (1) that (according to Laverdière) the place
where Champlain "came to an anchor on the North Shoare over against one
small island," was the little island formerly existing opposite the
Place Royale (which was not, however, named till 1611) and now joined
to the main land by the present harbour piers; (2) that incidentally
he thus indicates the site of the present harbour of Montreal; that
Champlain was the first to note that Montreal, or Hochelaga, was an
island, this being deduced from his description of the great island
(not named by him) "on the north side which continueth some fifteen
leagues in length and almost as much in breadth," etc; (3) that the
"mountain neere the said Sault which discovereth farre into the
country" is the same as that named by Jacques Cartier as Mount Royal
while "the Little River which falleth from the said mountain into the
lake" is the Rivière des Prairies; (4) that while he gives no names
beyond that of Sault yet he has left us a very clear indication that he
was familiar with the site of the present Island of Montreal. From the
above quotations there is no explicit mention of the suitability of the
Island of Montreal as a future trading post, yet there is little doubt
but that Champlain had it in his mind as such when the occasion should
serve.

Their adventurers afterward went up to the Sault which became the goal

Lawrence during the period, already described, of the temporary removal
of the prohibition against private traders. Certain it is that as early
as 1610 Lescarbot had remarked that of all the islands in the river St.
Lawrence the most suitable for commerce was without contradiction that
of Montreal. (Cf. "La Conversion des Sauvages Baptisés En Canada.") But
it was reserved for Champlain in 1611 to put this notion into effect
and to become the pioneer trader and the first harbour builder of
Montreal. His own narration of the events of 1611 may serve to prove
these claims.


THE CHOICE OF MONTREAL AS A TRADING POST

"In the year 1611, I took back my savage to those of his tribe, who
were to come to Sault St. Louis, intending to get my servant whom they
had as a hostage. I left Quebec, May 20 (21), and arrived at these
great rapids[24] the 28th of the month. I immediately went in a canoe
with the savage which I had taken to France and one of our men. After
having looked on all sides, not only in the woods, but also along the
river bank, to find a suitable place for the site of a settlement, and
to prepare a place in which to build, I went eight leagues by land,
along the rapids through the woods, which are rather open, and as far
as the lake,[25] where our savages took me. There I contemplated the
country very much in detail. But in all that I saw I did not find any
place at all more suitable than a little spot which is just where the
barks and shallops can come easily, either with a strong wind or by
a winding course, because of the strength of the current. Above this
place (which we named La Place Royale), a league from Mount Royal,
there are a great many little rocks and shoals, which are dangerous."


THE SITUATION OF PLACE ROYALE DESCRIBED

"And near this Place Royale there is a little river running back a
goodly way into the interior, all along which there are more than sixty
acres of cleared land, like meadows, where one might sow grain and
make gardens. Formerly savages tilled there. There were also a great
number of other beautiful meadows, to support as many cattle as one
wishes, and all kinds of trees that we have in our forests at home,
with a great many vines, walnuts, plum trees, cherries, strawberries
and other kinds which are very good to eat. Among others there is one
very excellent, which has a sweet taste resembling that of plantains
(which is a fruit of the Indies), and is as white as snow, with a leaf
like that of the nettle, and running on trees or the ground like ivy.
Fishing is very good there, and there are all the kinds that we have
in France, and a great many others that we do not have, which are
very good; as is also game of all kinds; and hunting is good, stags,
hinds, does, caribous, rabbits, lynxes, bears, beavers and other little
animals which so abound that while we were at these rapids we never
were without them."


PLACE ROYALE CLEARED AND A HARBOUR REVETMENT WALL BUILT

"After having made a careful exploration, then, and found this place
one of the most beautiful on this river, I at once had the woods cut
down[26] and cleared from this Place Royale, to make it level and ready
for building. Water can easily be made to flow around it, making a
little island of it, and a settlement can be made there as one may wish.

"There is a little island[27] twenty fathoms from this Place Royale
which is about one hundred paces long, whereon could be put up a good,
well defended set of buildings. There are also a great many meadows
containing good potter's clay, whether for bricks or to build with,
which is a great convenience. I had some of it worked up, and made a
wall of it four feet thick, and from three to four feet high and ten
fathoms long, to see how it would last in the winter when then the
floods came down, which in my opinion, would not rise to this wall
although the land is about twelve feet above that river, which is quite
high."


ST. HELEN'S ISLAND NAMED

"In the middle of the river there is an island about three-quarters
of a league in circumference, where a good and strong town could be
built and I named it Ile de Ste. Hélène.[28] These rapids descend into
a sort of lake where there are two or three islands and some beautiful
meadows."


CHAMPLAIN PLANTS GARDENS

"While waiting for the savages I had two gardens made: one in the
meadows and the other in the woods which I had cleared; and the second
day of June I sowed some seeds in them, which came up in perfect
condition and in a little while, which showed the goodness of the soil.

"I resolved to send Savignon, our savage, with another, to meet those
of his country, in order to make them come quickly; and they hesitated
to go in our canoe which they distrusted, for it was not good for much."


CHAMPLAIN EXPLORES THE NEIGHBOURHOOD

"On the seventh I went to explore a little river[29] by which sometimes
the savages go to war, which leads to the rapids of the river of the
Iroquois.[30] It is very pleasant, with meadows on it, more than three
leagues in circumference, and a great deal of land which could be
tilled. It is one league from the great rapids[31] and a league and a
half from Place Royale.

"On the ninth our savage arrived. He had been a little way beyond the
lake,[32] which is about ten leagues long, that I have seen before.
He did not meet anything there, and could not go any further, because
their canoe gave out and they were obliged to return."

This savage reported the loss of the life of a young man, Louis, who
had lost his life in the rapids. There is a discussion as to whether
Champlain called the rapids the Sault "St. Louis" in commemoration of
this event or in honour of Louis XIII of France, who began reigning
the year previously and from whom Champlain had received a commission
to build storehouses for the fur trade near the rapids. The solution
I leave to the choice of the reader. At this time "Heron" island at
the St. Louis rapids received its name. There seems no doubt that
if Champlain had as thoroughly investigated the possibilities and
advantages of climate, soil and natural position as a trading centre
of Montreal in 1603 as he did in 1611, he would have chosen Montreal,
for the settlement in 1603, instead of Quebec, which was after all de
Monts' choice. In the account of 1603 Champlain had said: "The air is
softer and more temperate than at any other place that I have seen in
this country."

In this same account of 1611 we get a picture of the first trading
reported at Montreal which is worth recording.


THE FIRST TRADING TRANSACTION AT MONTREAL

"On the 13th of this month (June 13, 1611), 200 Huron savages with the
chiefs, Ochateguin, Iroquet, and Tregourote, brothers of our savage,
brought back my lad. We were very glad to see them, and I went to meet
them with a canoe and our savage. Meantime, they advanced quietly in
order, our men preparing to give them a salvo with the arquebuses and
some small pieces. As they were approaching, they began to shout all
together, and one of their chiefs commanded their addresses to be made,
in which they praised us highly, calling us truthful, in that I had
kept my word to them, to come to find them at these rapids. After they
had given three more shouts, a volley of musketry was fired twice,
which astonished them so much that they asked me to tell them that
there should not be any shooting, saying that the greater number of
them never had seen Christians before, nor heard thunderings of that
sort, and that they were afraid of its doing them harm.... After a good
deal of discourse they made me a present of 100 beavers. I gave them in
exchange some other kinds of merchandise."


CHAMPLAIN THE FIRST WHITE MAN TO SHOOT THE RAPIDS

These Indians camped about with Champlain for some days till they
returned to their own part of the rapids, "some leagues into the
woods." Champlain accompanied them. He now tells of his historic
shooting the rapids which we may place as happening on the 17th of
June, 1611.

"When I had finished with them I begged them to take me back in our
despatch boat. To do this they prepared eight canoes to run the rapids,
and stripped themselves naked, and made me take off everything but my
shirt; for often it happens that some are lost in shooting the rapids;
therefore they keep close to one another, to aid one another promptly
if a canoe should happen to capsize. They said to me, 'If by chance
yours should happen to turn over, as you do not know how to swim, on no
account abandon it, but hold on to the little sticks that are in the
middle, for we will save you easily.' I assure you that those who have
not seen or passed this place in these little boats that they have,
could not pass it without great fear, even the most self-possessed
persons in the world. But these people are so skillful in shooting
these rapids that it is easy for them. I did it with them--a thing that
I never had done, nor had any Christian, except my youth--and we came
to our barks where I lodged a large number of them."

The next day, the 18th of June, the party broke up; Champlain set out
for Quebec, which he says he reached on the 19th, shortly to leave for
France. He describes the parting at Montreal thus: "After they had
traded the little that they had, they separated into three groups--one
to go to war, one to go up the rapids--they set out on the 18th day of
this month, and we also."

The quotations I have chosen cover nearly four weeks of Champlain's
dwelling at his new post. I have let him speak himself. The picture
he draws enables us to construct in our imagination the picturesque
situation of our city at this time.


GRAND SAULT, 1613

In 1613 Champlain tells us in his journal published in 1632, that
having left Quebec on March 13th he arrived at the Sault on the 21st.
He does not mention stopping at his trading post at Place Royale; he
must have visited it and done some trading and put his boats up; but
he set out on May 27th in his canoes "from the Isle of St. Hélène" with
four Frenchmen and a savage. His object was at present to discover
the Mer du Nord, lately discovered by Hudson and of which a map had
appeared in Paris in 1612. One of the four Frenchmen with him in
his canoes was named Nicholas de Vignau. This man had been sent in
preceding years to make discoveries for Champlain and in 1612, while
in Paris, this man reported to Champlain that he had seen this same
"Mer du Nord." Champlain consequently took him with him to lead the
way, with the result that can be judged from his own description of de
Vignau, as "the boldest liar that had been seen for a long time." It
was on this fruitless exploration that on the Portage route by way of
Muskrat and Mudlakes, Champlain lost his astrolabe, the instrument then
used for astronomical observation. Near this place he ceases giving
the correct latitudes as he had been doing. Two hundred and fifty-four
years later, a farmer on an August day unearthed an old brass astrolabe
of Paris make, dated 1603. We may safely conclude it was Champlain's.

On the voyage up the Ottawa he described the visit to Allumette Island,
45° 47'. "After having observed the poorness of the soil, I asked them
how they enjoyed cultivating so poor a country, in view of the fact
that there was some much better, than that they left deserted and
abandoned at the Rapids of St. Louis. They answered me that they were
obliged to do so to keep themselves secure and that the roughness of
the place served them as a bulwark against their enemies. But they said
that if I would make a settlement a Frenchman at the Rapids of St.
Louis, as I had promised to do, they would leave their dwelling place
to come and settle near us, being assured that their enemies would not
do them harm while we were with them. I told them that this year we
should make preparations with wood and stones to make a fort next year
and cultivate the land. When they heard this they gave a great shout,
as a sign of applause. After this the conference finished."

After having explored the Ottawa River they returned from the fruitless
search for the Northern sea on June 17th and continued their course
till "we reached the barks and were saluted by some discharges of
canon, at which some of the savages were delighted and others very
much astonished, never having heard such music. Having landed, Sieur
de Maisonneuve[33] de Saint Malo came to me with the passport for
three vessels from Monseigneur the Prince. As soon as I had seen it, I
let him and his men enjoy the benefit of it, like ourselves, and had
the savages told that they might trade the next day." The place of
the barks would, undoubtedly, be the little harbour at Place Royale
described in the account of 1611, and near his trading fort.

After having made de Vignau confess himself of his lie, "as the savages
would not have him, no matter how much I begged them, we left him to
the protection of God." Champlain then left for Tadoussac, at which he
arrived on July 6th, whence he shortly sailed to France.

[Illustration: MODERN TADOUSSAC]

On this journey in France, Champlain set about to secure clergy and
through the intervention of Sieur Hoüel, secretary of the king, he got
the Recollect Fathers whom he said "would be the right ones there, both
for residence at our settlement and for the conversion of the infidels.
I agreed with this opinion, as they are without ambition and live
altogether in conformity to the rule of St. Francis."

On April 24, 1615, Champlain left Honfleur with four Franciscan
Recollects Denis Jamay, Jean d'Olbeau, Joseph le Caron and the lay
brother, Pacifique du Plessis, reaching Tadoussac on May 25th. The
Recollects he left at Quebec whence he hastened to the Sault, soon to
be followed by Father Jean le Caron. The importance that Champlain
gives to his trading post at the rapids to which he hurried will be
seen from the following quotation. On arriving at Tadoussac, "we began
to set men to work to fit up our barks, in order to go to Quebec,
the place of our settlement, and to the great Rapids of St. Louis,
the great gathering place of the savages who come there to trade.
Immediately upon my arrival at the rapids I visited these people who
were very anxious to see us and delighted at our return, from their
hopes that we would give them some of our number to help them in
their wars against their enemies. They explained that it would be
hard for them to come to us if we did not assist them, because the
Iroquois, their old enemies, were always along the trail and kept the
passage closed to them. Besides I had always promised to aid them in
their wars, as they gave us to understand through their interpreter.
Whereupon I perceived that it was very necessary to assist them,
not only to make them love us more, but also to pave the way for my
undertakings and discoveries, which to all appearance could not be
accomplished except by their help; and also because this would be to
them a sort of first step and preparation to coming into Christianity;
and to secure this I decided to go thither and explore their country
and aid them in their wars, in order to oblige them to show me what
they had so many times promised to.

"I had them all gather to tell them my intention, upon hearing which
they promised to furnish us 2,500 men of war, who would do wonders,
while I on my part, was to bring, for the same purpose as many men as
I could; which I promised them, being very glad to see them come to
so wise a decision. Then I began to explain to them the methods to
follow in fighting in which they took a singular pleasure. When all the
matters were decided upon, we separated with the intention of returning
to carry out our undertaking."

This alliance which Champlain then made against the Iroquois will help
to explain the prolonged animosity of these against the Hurons, and
later their allies, the settlers of Ville Marie, under Maisonneuve.
But, as yet Champlain's fort was only a summer trading post, and such
it remained till 1642. He had it in his mind to make it a regular
settlement, and it would seem likely to become so.

On the occasion of the above gathering mass was said by the Recollects
for the first time in Canada, at least since the time of Cartier.

We may briefly narrate the events leading up to this. Owing to the
trading monopolies being granted on condition that the conversion of
the savages to the Catholic faith should be attempted and owing to
the discontentment existing at the continued unfulfillment of this
condition, de Monts and other merchants found that they would have to
take means to comply with it or lose their monopoly.

The merchants were keener on the peltry trade than on the civilization
of the country. They did not welcome colonists from France nor did they
desire the Indians to settle down in their neighbourhood. They wanted
them to get busy to bring in their furs. They were there for business
solely, although their charter said otherwise.

So it was, with bad grace, they had to yield. Champlain must,
however, be disassociated from this opposition. For he had willingly
undertaken the negotiations to obtain the Recollect Fathers through the
intermediary of the pious Sieur de Hoüel, the controller general of the
salt mines of Brouage, one of the few members of the de Monts company
that was not a Huguenot; accordingly after some negotiations during
the winter of 1614 and 1615, the four Franciscan Recollects mentioned,
three priests, Denis Jamay, superior, Jean d'Olbeau, Joseph le Caron,
and Brother Pacifique du Plessis embarked with Champlain at Honfleur
on April 24, 1615, on the St. Etienne, one of the company's ships
commanded by Dupont Gravé. They arrived at Tadoussac in a month.

On their arrival in Quebec in the beginning of June three of them
stayed to lay out their dwelling and build their chapel, but Father
Joseph le Caron, a very eager and apostolic man, went straight off to
the Indians at the Sault. Becoming quickly acquainted with the mode
of life of the natives there and desirous of their conversion to the
knowledge of Jesus Christ, he determined to spend the winter with
them. "In Canada and its Provinces," Father Lewis Drummond says that
on his journey down, le Caron met Champlain and Father Denis Jamay at
Rivière des Prairies. They tried to persuade him not to winter with the
Indians. But he hastened to Quebec, reaching it on June 20, and on his
return to Rivière des Prairies met Champlain and Father Jamay there,
and mass was celebrated. His object in hurrying back to Quebec was to
obtain the necessary altar equipment and other missionary necessaries.

On arriving at the Isle of Montreal he met Champlain and his canoes at
the entrance of the Rivière des Prairies. These no doubt were preparing
for the exploration of the Ottawa.

There on June 24, 1615, the feast of St. Jean Baptiste, afterwards
taken for the patronal feast of Canada, Fathers Denis and Joseph sang
mass at their portable altar on the banks of the Rivière des Prairies.
"With all devotion," Champlain chronicles, "before these peoples who
were in admiration at the ceremonies and at the vestments which seemed
to them so beautiful as being something they had never seen before;
for these religious are the first who had celebrated the holy mass
there."[34] (This solemn occasion was followed by the chanting of
the Te Deum to the accompaniment of a fusillade of small artillery
with all the pomp that circumstances permitted.) Father Denis Jamay
went back to Quebec to minister to the French Catholics and to form
a sedentary mission for the natives; while there also he could excur
to Threvers as a mission post. He was helped by Brother Pacifique
du Plessis. Jean le Caron now joined a band of Hurons and passed the
winter with them in one of their stockades called Carhagouaha defended
by a triple palisade of wood to the height of thirty feet. Father Jean
d'Olbeau departed for Quebec, on December 2d, to share the fortunes of
the Montagnais below Tadoussac.

[Illustration: THE FIRST MASS IN CANADA AT RIVIERE DES PRAIRIES, JUNE
24, 1615

(After George Delfosse)]

While treating of the early history of the Recollects we may now
anticipate by a few years a circumstance of tragic importance. In the
year 1625 there occurred at the Sault-au-Récollet an event which has
given it its name. This year, the Recollect father, Nicholas Viel,
had gone two years before with Fathers Joseph le Caron and Gabriel
Sagard, to the country of the Hurons. They were now invited by the
Hurons to descend the river to trade with the settlement at Quebec.
Father Viel had accepted the invitation because he wished to make his
annual spiritual retreat at the Convent of Notre Dame des Anges and
he took with him one of his Indian neophytes, whom he had instructed
and baptized, a young boy named Ahuntsic. Among the convoy, in the
same canoe, were some Indians who were secretly ill disposed to the
missionary and when they found themselves separated from the other
canoes by bad weather on the river, they fell upon Father Viel and
Ahuntsic in the last sault near to Montreal and the swift flowing
rapids soon submerged them in their deep waters. The spots of Ahuntsic
and Sault-au-Récollet commemorate this event although the disaster
occurred at the latter place as said.

[Illustration: THE MARTYRDOM OF THE RECOLLET VIEL AND THE NEOPHYTE
AHUNTSIC AT SAULT-AU-RECOLLET. (After George Delfosse)]

Later in the summer of 1615 Champlain redeemed his pledge to explore
the Indian country. On the 9th of July, 1615, Champlain left the fort
with two men, one of whom was his servant, and another an interpreter,
and ten savages to manage the two canoes on a voyage of exploration.
Father le Caron had already gone ahead. Champlain's expedition with
the allied tribes into the country of the Iroquois was one of the most
important undertakings of his life--both on account of the length of
the journey and the knowledge he obtained of the lake region. He lost
prestige by this journey, however, both with the Indians and his French
Canadians. It is not to our purpose to follow him on this voyage but we
cannot refrain from mentioning the Huron village of Carhagouaha which
lay between Nottawasaga Bay and Lake Simcoe. It was to this village
that Father le Caron bent his steps, and where Champlain joined him
on August 12th. The triple palisades, long houses, containing several
households and other distinctive features of the village of Hochelaga
discovered by Cartier, were there reproduced. He returned to the post
at the end of June, 1616, and there he found Sieur du Pont. "We also
saw," he says, "all the holy Fathers (Father Jamay and Brother du
Plessis) who had remained at our settlement and they were very glad
to see us and we to see them." Thus the Recollect fathers having left
"our" settlement at Quebec had come up to Montreal as we may call the
post at the Rapids. From their arrival dates the ecclesiastical life of
our city and the introduction of Christianity. Champlain left the Sault
on the 8th day of July, 1616, reaching Quebec on July 11. Shortly, on
August 3d, he sailed to France.

Champlain was a good advertising agent, as the following shows: "During
my sojourn at the settlement I had some of the common corn cut--that
is, the French corn that had been planted there--which was very
beautiful, in order to carry some to France, to show that this soil
is very good and fertile. There was also some very fine Indian corn
and some grafts and trees that we had brought thither." This contrasts
favourably with the gloomy report given to France by Jacques Cartier of
the Canadian climate, which doubtless influenced the delay of organized
colonization. It is evident that Champlain was still thinking of making
Montreal a permanent settlement. From the memoirs of 1615-16 we learn
that Champlain before leaving for France took with him to Quebec an
Indian, Daronthal or Aronthal, whom he called his host. This man,
after admiring the buildings and the civilization of the settlement
of Quebec, and being desirous that his people should become better
acquainted with the religion of the Christians "in order to learn to
serve God and to understand our way of living," suggested that they
should be attracted to live with the settlers.

"He suggested," says Champlain, "that for the advancement of this work,
we should make another settlement at the St. Louis rapids, so as to
give them a safe passage of the river, for fear of their enemies; and
said that once they would come in great numbers to us to live there
like brothers. I promised to do this as soon as I could." Daronthal was
sent back with this promise to his companions at St. Louis rapids, but
it was reserved for Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, twenty-six
years later to carry it out.


FOOTNOTES:

[23] Through the intervention of and in the presence of Pierre du Gas,
Sieur de Monts, as the matrimonial contract dated Paris, December
27, 1610, states, Champlain had contracted to marry after two years
Hélène de Boullé, a young girl not yet in her twelfth year and not
yet marriageable, the daughter of Nicolas Boullé, secretary of the
King's Chamber, a Huguenot like his friend de Monts. In this contract
Champlain made her heiress of all the property that he might be able to
leave, and her parents consented to give him before the marriage 6,000
_livres_.

On the 29th of December, in the church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois,
Champlain was handed over four thousand five hundred of the promised
_livres_. On the next day the marriage took place. Hélène Boullé became
a Catholic after two years. Shortly after the marriage Champlain left
for New France, leaving his wife behind. We find him at the Grand Sault
on May 28, 1611.

withdrew, and here burnt his flags in the presence of his army the
night previous to surrendering the colony to the English. Louis Honoré
Frechette, the national French-Canadian poet, bases upon this his poem,

In 1688 the island was acquired by Charles Le Moyne, Sieur de
Longueuil, who gave the name of Ste. Hélène to one of his most
distinguished sons. During the eighteenth century (from before 1723),
his descendants, the Barons of Longueuil, whose territory lay just
opposite, had a residence here, the ruins of which, once surrounded
with gardens, are to be seen upon it on the east side. The Government
acquired it from them by arrangement during the War of 1812, and later
by purchase in 1818, for military purposes. It ceded the park portion
to the city in 1874.

Almost adjoining it, at the lower extremity, is Ile Ronde, a small low
island.

Both islands are interesting geologically from the occurrence there of
a remarkable breccia containing inclusions of Devonian Limestone, and
also from the existence of some rare types of dyke rock.

[33] Who is this Maisonneuve appearing as a privileged trader with
the passport of the prince, doubtless the Prince de Condé, Henri de
Bourbon, viceroy of Canada and head of Champlain's company? Evidently
he was a person of some consequence from the ease with which Champlain
granted him permission to trade at his settlement. Can it be, as
Kingsford and others ingeniously try to prove, Paul Chomedey de
Maisonneuve, who was later to found Montreal as a settlement in 1642,
acting for "La Compagnie de Montreal?" (1) No. Chomedey was from Paris;
the de Maisonneuve mentioned above is from St. Malo. (2) de Maisonneuve
was a common enough name. There were even several of that name in
Montreal in 1667.

[34] Mass was only said at Quebec for the first time on June 25, 1615,
by which time they had built their chapel. The priority of the Island
of Montreal in its claim to the first mass is substantiated by the
"_Mémoires des Recollects_" of 1637 which distinctly say that "the
first mass was celebrated at Rivière des Prairies and the second at
Quebec."

COLONIZATION

UNDER THE COMPANY OF ONE HUNDRED ASSOCIATES

     THE CHARTER OF THE HUNDRED ASSOCIATES THE BASIS OF THE SEIGNEURIAL
     SYSTEM TO BE AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED AT MONTREAL--THE ENGLISH
     IN 1629 CAPTURE QUEBEC--1632, CANADA AGAIN CEDED TO THE
     FRENCH--1633, THE COMING OF THE JESUITS--THE RECOLLECTS DO NOT
     RETURN--THREE RIVERS IS ESTABLISHED--DESCRIPTION OF COLONIAL
     LIFE AT QUEBEC--DEATH OF CHAMPLAIN IN 1635--THE RELIGIOUS
     INSTITUTIONS TO BE IMITATED AFTERWARDS AT MONTREAL--THE "RELATIONS
     DES JESUITES"--THE IROQUOIS BEGIN THEIR ATTACKS--THE NEWS OF A
     REINFORCEMENT AND DISAPPOINTMENT THAT MONTREAL HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS
     ITS HEADQUARTERS.


On April 29, 1627, Richelieu, the Superintendent of Marine and
Commerce, securing the resignation of the Duke de Vantadour and
annulling the privileges of de Caen and his associates with suitable
indemnities, formed a new association under the title of the "Hundred
Associates of the Company of New France," among whom were many
gentlemen of rank. It was resolved that in the following year of 1628
a colony of two to three hundred men of all trades, all professing the
Catholic religion, would be sent over--to be increased in the following
fifteen years to four thousand, of both sexes. At that time the sole
population of New France was seventy-six souls.

It is well here to consider the conditions of the charter now
given, for it is the ground plan of all subsequent French Canadian
colonization schemes, and Montreal will be affected by it. We have seen
the Huguenots were now to be excluded (not, however, from engaging in
commerce in Canada, but only from _settling_ there). From all points
of view, political and religious and colonial, this was necessary. To
show that there was to be no harshness in the execution of this we may
only point out that Champlain was in charge and he knew Huguenots well
and had worked harmoniously with them. We have seen that since the
companies had been mainly Huguenots, colonization had not succeeded
owing to mutual jealousies. If Canada was to be saved, it was by
colonization, and this could never be carried out with a divided
people. Even Huguenots realized this point. For at the time they were
enjoying full privileges of citizenship as has been said. Hence it was
only by imposing law and order and uniformity of religious belief,
that happy and contented communities could be expected to spread in
Canada.

Richelieu at this time was eager to form a powerful navy and he thought
the possession of thriving colonies would advance the scheme. Hence it
was a wise policy that was now inaugurated. Unfortunately engrossing
interests at home did not allow Richelieu to pursue his scheme for
government promotion of colonization on the broad basis originally
projected by him.

To carry out the conditions of receiving the number of colonists the
King obliged the Company of One Hundred Associates to lodge, board and
maintain for three years all the French they should transport to the
colony. After which, they could be discharged from their obligation,
if they had put the colonists in the way of making their own living,
either by distributing them on cleared land and supplying them with
grain for a first crop, or otherwise. To provide for the maintenance
of the established church there should be three ecclesiastics in each
of the settlements to be formed during fifteen years, maintained in
food and lodging and in everything necessary for the exercise of their
ministry. In compensation for their outlay in advance, the king handed
over to the Associates the Seigneury of Quebec and of the whole of New
France, with the reserve of fealty and homage and a crown of gold of
the weight of eight marks, to be paid at each succeeding reign, and
finally, of the institution of officers of Sovereign Justice to be
nominated and presented by the Associates, when it should be deemed
proper to have them appointed. Moreover, Louis XIII made a gift to the
Associates of two war vessels of three hundred tons, ready equipped for
sailing, and four culverins, with this clause, however, that if at the
end of the first ten years they had not carried over fifteen hundred
French of both sexes, they should pay the price of the aforesaid
vessels. Among other privileges the king granted twelve patents of
nobility signed, sealed and delivered, with a blank space left for the
names of those of the Associates who shall be presented by the company
and who shall enjoy with their heirs, born in lawful wedlock, these
privileges for all time, thus starting the Seigneurial Land Tenure
system which in 1854 yielded to that of freehold.

With regard to commerce, the company should have perpetual privileges
in the peltry traffic of New France, and for fifteen years only, all
other commerce by land and sea with the reservation of the cod and
whale fishery which should be free to all French traders. The colonists
not maintained at the expense of the Associates should be free to trade
with the natives for peltry provided that they forthwith hand over the
peltry to the company which shall be obliged to purchase at the rate of
forty _sols_, Tours currency, for each beaver skin. In consequence, the
privileges accorded previously to Guillaume de Caen and his associates
were revoked by the same edict, and trade in Canada was interdicted
to them and other subjects of the kingdom, under pain of confiscation
of their vessels and merchandise to the benefit of the new company.
Cardinal Richelieu, however, allowed Guillaume de Caen, the privilege
of the peltry trade for one year in indemnification for the loss of his
charter.

So started the Company of the One Hundred Associates under the happiest
auspices, endowed with almost sovereign power and having a leader
of the state as its patron, for at its head was Cardinal Richelieu,
who, without the title of lieutenant general which he perhaps thought
unnecessary, seeing that he connected the work of colonization with
his position as head of the navy, exercised the same authority. On
the 27th of April, 1628, Louis XIII sent Champlain his commission as
"commander in New France in the absence of our very dear and well
beloved cousin, the Cardinal de Richelieu, grand master, chief and
superintendent of the navigation and commerce of France." Champlain did
not receive his commission on behalf of the company until he reached
Dieppe in 1629, after the occupation of Quebec by the English.

The first attempt to carry out the charter was in 1628, when vessels
were equipped and victualled under the orders of de Roquemont, one of
the chief associates. Their first object was to succour Quebec, then
in famine. A number of artisans and their families started and never
reached their destination, for in the gulf their ships were seized
by David Kerth, a master mariner of Dieppe in pay of the English
government and in command of its fleet attacking the colonies. War had
broken out between England and France and hostilities soon extended to
America, and a fleet of ships was sent to invade the settlements of New
France and in particular to capture Quebec.

It is not our duty to tell the story of Quebec or to recount the noble
defence of Champlain till the fall of the city on July 29, 1629, when
Louis Kerth, the brother of the admiral, installed himself as the
governor general, representing the English. The state of the colony at
the end of this siege interests us. Of the French, there only remained
at Quebec the families of the widow of Hébert and of their son-in-law,
Couillard, and these intended to leave after the harvest, but in the
event they were constrained to stay. The rest passed over by way of
Tadoussac into France and with them Champlain, who went to England to
call upon the French ambassador, urging him to demand the restitution
of Quebec on the ground that it had been captured two months after
the expiration of the short war between the two nations. Canada as a
province _quoad civilia_ was under Normandy, and hence it became to be
believed that it was also _quoad sacra_ under Normandy.

[Illustration: THE TAKING OF QUEBEC IN 1629

(From Hennepin, Edition 1698.)]

It is now 1632, the year of the treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye when
Acadia and Canada were again ceded to the French. For three years Louis
Kerth kept Quebec in the name of England and on July 13, he formally
handed over a heap of ruins to Emery de Caen, who conducted the first
contingent of the returning French. "But for our habitation," says
Champlain, "my people have found it utterly consumed along with good
beaver skins valued at 40,000 _livres_."

Meanwhile, the Company of the Hundred Associates was again empowered
to resume possession and Champlain was commissioned anew as acting
governor of all the country along the St. Lawrence, and was appointed
commander of the fleet of three vessels bearing new colonists. He
arrived at Quebec with a good nucleus for the revived colony on May
23, 1633, and was received by a salute of cannon by Emery de Caen.
Among the colonists brought by him there were persons of distinction
who, wearied with religious dissensions in their own provinces, sought
in New France that tranquility denied them in the old, and many rural
labourers and artisans of different trades. As these were mostly from
the diocese of Rouen, the clergy now arriving were the Jesuits, Fathers
Massé and Brébeuf, sent under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop
of Rouen. The Recollects were no longer allowed to return, on the
ground that, theirs being an order which could not own property or
revenues, they were unsuitable for a country where means were needed
to gather together the Indians in settlements in buildings in which
they could band together to be instructed. The chapel of the Recollects
destroyed by the English was rebuilt. The work of reconstruction of
the settlement now began in earnest. What interests us now is to learn
that on July 1st of this year Champlain, at the request of the Indian
allies, sent many workmen to Three Rivers to construct a fort and a fur
factory there. Although Three Rivers had been used as a trading post,
it had only been so temporarily, in the same manner that Montreal, or
the post of the Sault St. Louis, had been the meeting place for the
natives and traders engaged in the fur traffic.

[Illustration: This view of Fort Amsterdam on the Manhattan is copied
from an ancient engraving executed in Holland. The fort was erected
in 1623, but finished upon the above model by Governor Van Twiller in
1635.]

At Quebec there was now great harmony. A lasting colony was
established. Piety and religion flourished and the seeds of a good and
noble population for Canada were sown. After many struggles success
seemed now to be rewarding the efforts of Champlain. One shudders to
think of what the future of Canada had been if the "convict" colonies
of Roberval and la Roche had come to any permanency. We may note now
two important movements helping to civilize the natives, which show
the real desire of the new régime to fulfill its vocation. The first
was the endeavour made by Champlain to nip in the bud the sale of
intoxicating liquors to the natives in exchange for peltry already
introduced by the preceding companies and by the English under Kerth.
Champlain forbade anyone to trade wine or _eau de vie_ with the natives
under penalty of corporal punishment and the loss of their salaries
as servants of the company. The second was the establishment by the
Jesuits of a free boarding school for boys in the house of Notre Dame
des Anges left them by the Recollects for the instruction of the Huron
children. This method of civilization of the natives already employed
by the Recollects was considered a most useful preliminary to the
civilization of the natives by thus Gallicizing and Christianizing
them, and attracted many.

[Illustration: CHAMPLAIN'S FORTIFIED RESIDENCE AT QUEBEC]

That all these institutions were in line with Champlain's policy we see
in Champlain's letter to Cardinal Richelieu, dated August 15, 1635.
After saying that some of the Indians were sedentary and lived in
villages and towns, while others were migratory hunters and fishers,
all led by no other desire than to have a number of Frenchmen and
religious teachers to instruct them in the faith, he adds, "We require
but 120 men light armed for protection against the arrows. Possessing
them, with two or three thousand more Indians, our allies, in a year we
can render ourselves absolute masters of all these peoples by bringing
among them the necessary good government and this policy would increase
the worship of religion and an inconceivable commerce. The whole for
the glory of God." In the last phrase we may see Champlain's whole
policy unfolded.

But the days of Samuel de Champlain, Sieur de Brouage, were drawing to
a close. To found this colony he had suffered many perils by land and
sea, many fatigues, privations and opposition of friends and enemies.
Paralysis now weakened his splendid physique and sturdy form, and after
two months and a half of suffering he died on Christmas day, December
25, 1635. His death was most edifying, as the Jesuit chronicler
relates. His obsequies were attended by the grief-stricken colony in a
body, the settlers, the soldiers, the captains and the religious.

Father Lalemant officiated and Father Lejeune pronounced the funeral
oration: Samuel de Champlain merits well of Canada. His death was
apparently foreseen, for after the above ceremony while the
gathering was still present, letters which had been left in the
hands of Father Lejeune by the Company, to be opened after the death
of Champlain, were publicly read announcing the appointment by
letters patent of the Messieurs de la Compagnie of M. Bras-de-Fer de
Chateaufort, the commandant of the young fort at Three Rivers, as
acting governor _ad interim_ for Mgr. the Duke of Richelieu, while
awaiting the successor of Champlain to be named by the king.

The arrival of the ships from France, the next year, were eagerly
looked forward to, albeit with some anxiety, for France being at war
with Spain many doubted whether they would arrive, but to their delight
they came in greater number than could have been expected, and on the
night preceding the eleventh day of June, the new governor nominated
by the Company and approved by the king arrived. This was Charles
Hualt de Montmagny, Knight of Malta. The reception he received next
morning was most imposing. He was met officially at the harbour, and
conducted to the chapel of Notre Dame de Recouvrance, and thence to
the parish church where a Te Deum was sung with prayers for the king.
Then he mounted to the fortress where M. de Chateaufort, the temporary
governor, handed over the keys amid the roar of cannon and the salvos
of musketry. With M. de Montmagny there arrived a convoy of forty-five
colonists--a notable increase. Among these were some families of
note such as those of M. de Repentigny and M. de la Potherie. Next
year, there came others, with many persons of distinction. A certain
element of official dignity now began to prevail. It was de Montmagny's
chief work to organize and strengthen the defences of the colony in
preparation against the attacks of the Iroquois. At Quebec the governor
reinforced the redoubt built by Champlain on the river by a platform
and added more cannon to the battery. This new military aspect of the
colony is described by the chronicler in the "Relations of the Jesuits
for 1636."

"The morning gun (or the beat of the drum at dawn in the garrison)
awakens us every morning. We see the sentinels put on post; the guard
house is always well manned; each squad has its days of duty. It is a
pleasure to see our soldiers at military exercises in the sweet time of
peace ... in a word, our fortress of Quebec is guarded in peace so as
to be a place of importance, in the heat of war."

With the assistance of M. Chateaufort, reinstated as commandant of
the growing fort at Three Rivers, the palisaded stockade there was
reinforced with two main buildings, a storehouse and a platform for
the cannons. These external signs of power were necessary to impress
the natives, both their allies, the Hurons and Algonquins, should
they prove treacherous, as well as the fierce Iroquois, the deadly
enemies of both. The little garrisons had need to be well prepared for
eventualities.

At this time several foundations in the colony were established, by
private charity, to Christianize the natives and to encourage them
to live a sedentary life and to till the ground. A mission village
was built for them by the Jesuits in 1638 at Sillery, on the banks of
the St. Lawrence, at a distance of four miles from Quebec, the funds
being supplied by the charity of a member of the Hundred Associates,
a distinguished commander of Malta, Noël Brulart de Sillery, a former
Minister of State. At Three Rivers in 1641 similar action was taken.
A third was desired by the missionaries at the Rivière des Prairies
at the north of the Island of Montreal, as a central position for
missionary effort among the up-country tribes.

Tadoussac was visited by the missionaries from time to time, but was
too desolate a spot to attract the natives to dwell there permanently.
The Jesuits had thought of establishing themselves at Ile Jésus, for
there is an act of August 16, 1638, giving it to them at Three Rivers
and signed by Montmagny.

We have seen the establishment of a school for the Indian boys by
the Jesuits. We are now to record a similar one for girls, but who
should undertake inch a work for them? Two noble ladies of France were
to answer this question. The year 1639 saw the arrival at Quebec,
on August 1st, of a party of brave ladies whom we may know as the
pioneers of all those numerous philanthropic organizations and good
works controlled by the devoted women of Canada of today. These were
the ladies sent from France by Madame la Duchesse d'Aiguillon, the
niece of Cardinal Richelieu, and by Madame de la Peltrie, to assist the
struggling colony there.

I will here introduce the reader to what are known as the "Relations."
These are a series of letters or reports which were written by the
Jesuit missionaries in Nouvelle France, starting from the arrival of
Fathers Lalemant and Lejeune and continued long after. They have now
been collected and published, and are the most valuable historical
sources of this early period. They are written to the superiors of
their order in France, sent by the Company's boats, and were the source
of encouragement and inspiration to their religious brethren who
eagerly read them and desired to follow in their writers' footsteps in
the mission field of New France. Many others besides the Jesuits saw
these letters. The news contained in them was eagerly looked for by
many good ladies and gentlemen of France who were interested in the
progress of this romantic settlement among the savages in a far-off
land. The birth struggles of the new colony, the devotion and self
sacrifices of the pioneers, attracted their imagination and stirred
their sympathy and generosity.[35]

In 1634-35 Father Lejeune had written exposing the need of some
establishment to take care of the girls abandoned by the Indians and of
another for education similar to that, for boys, already constructed.
This "Relation" was read by the niece of Cardinal Richelieu, Madame
la Duchesse d'Aiguillon, and she wrote to the Jesuits: "God having
given me the desire to aid in the salvation of these poor savages,
after having read the report you have made of them, it seems to me
that what you believe would be of most service to their conversion is
the establishment of the Religeuses Hospitalières in New France; in
consequence I have resolved to send there this year six labourers to
clear the land and construct dwellings for these good ladies."

[Illustration: PAUL LEJEUNE

The first writer in the Jesuit "Relations."]

The foundation of a community of Ursuline nuns to undertake the
education of the young Indian girls was also similarly inspired this
year, by a good lady whose name is associated with the foundation
of Montreal. This was Madeleine de Chauvigny, the widow of M. de la
Peltrie, a gentleman of means who had died five and a half years
previously. Madame de la Peltrie had long felt impelled to the
religious life, but had been obliged by her father to marry. Being
now free she was anxious to devote her life to good works. But not
having decided whether it should be in New France or elsewhere she fell
dangerously ill, whereupon she made a vow that if she regained her
health she would devote her life and her property to New France. She
recovered quickly. It is related that the physician on visiting her,
remarked in surprise: "Madame, your illness has fled to Canada." The
coincidence of this remark with her own thoughts struck her imagination
and her only thought was now to make the necessary preparations.

[Illustration: MADAME DE LA PELTRIE]

There was at Tours an Ursuline nun named Mother Marie de l'Incarnation,
who was very interested in New France. This was known to Madame de la
Peltrie who now approached her so that shortly permission was granted
by the Archbishop of Tours to Mother Marie to be joined by Mother Marie
de Savonnine de St. Joseph of the same convent, and by Mother Cécile de
Ste. Croix from the Ursuline convent of Dieppe. Thus it was that Madame
de la Peltrie found herself at Quebec with these three and the three
"Hospitalières" sent by Madame d'Aiguillon, viz.: Sisters Marie de St.
Ignace, Superior, Anne de St. Bernard and Marie de St. Bonaventure.

[Illustration: VENERABLE MERE MARIE DE L'INCARNATION]

We must imagine the religious enthusiasm of the colonists at their
arrival and the eagerness with which the two new institutions were
begun, that of the hospital at Quebec and of the Ursuline convent at
Sillery.

But soon gloom was cast upon the little colony. Money and workmen from
the Company in France were needed and they came not. The explanation is
that the small sum of 300,000 _livres_, the original capital subscribed
by the One Hundred Associates, was dwindling, the expenses being
necessarily great, and the company of ladies and gentlemen composing
it, not being as practical as they were pious, so that although they
placed the commercial side of their affairs in the hands of traders,
these mainly looked after their own interests rather than those of the
colony.

The development of the struggling institutions lately mentioned was
hindered. To add to the general distress, on the 4th day of June,
1640, a fire quickly consumed the Church of Notre Dame de Recouvrance,
the house of the Jesuits and the governor's chapel, which were all of
resinous wood.

What a loss this must have been to the handful of colonists who
numbered in all in the year 1641 only 200! The mention of this number
reminds us of the charter given to the Company in 1627, and the reader
is advised to turn back and see how its conditions of colonization have
been filled. Outside the three religious communities and the persons
engaged in their service, the rest was composed of the servants of
the Company engaged in commerce. To add to their other troubles the
Iroquois again began their hostilities, declaring war against the
French and the Hurons. In the autumn of 1640 they captured two of the
French belonging to the garrison of Three Rivers. These were eventually
recaptured and the governor, M. de Montmagny, offered terms of peace if
they would conclude a universal peace with the Huron allies. During the
night, which the Iroquois had demanded to think over this proposition,
they treacherously laid plans to fall upon the French next day, in
which they were routed, escaping however at night in the shadows of the
woods.

Meanwhile news had also arrived of the ill treatment of the Jesuit
missionaries, Chaumont, Garnier, Poncet and Pijart, scattered away the
Indian tribes. All Quebec was in alarm and consternation, and nowhere
was there more fear than at the Indian village under the charge of
the Hospitalières sisters at Sillery, four miles from the garrison.
Such was the depression in the colony that in 1641 Father Viniont, now
superior of the Jesuits in Quebec, wrote home:

"It is going to be destroyed if it is not strongly and quickly
succoured. The trade of the Company, the colony of the French and the
religion which is now beginning to flourish among the savages, are at
the lowest point, if they do not quell the Iroquois. Fifty Iroquois,
since the Dutch have given them fire-arms, are capable of driving the
200 colonists out of the country."

It was in these desperate straits that news came of a reinforcement to
be sent to the colony; but what must have been their disappointment
and misgivings when they realized that the new Company had resolved
upon Montreal, sixty leagues away up at the Sault St. Louis, as their
rendezvous. And that the projected expedition was determined on
definitely, was made clear when the supply of provisions for the new
colony arrived at Quebec in 1840, very opportunely, however, for they
served for the use of the famished garrison, since the Company of One
Hundred Associates had neglected to provide their usual supply.

The survey of the colonization of New France up to 1641 shows that it
had been singularly unfruitful. The government of France had never
been more than lukewarm after Cartier's voyages. He had given a poor
account of the climate of the country, and the loss of a quarter of his
crew from scurvy must have confirmed it. Roberval sent on a government
expedition, lost fifty of his company and thereafter the private
companies all had their disasters from famine and disease to record,
beginning with that of Chauvin's, who, having left sixteen men at
Tadoussac for the winter, found eleven there on his return.

Were it not for the insatiable desire for commercial gain, through fur
monopolies, Canada would have been utterly deserted. There were no
industries developed to attract colonists. There had been no gold mines
or other treasures exploited to create rushes into a new and harsh
country, such as that of the Yukon of late years.

Agriculture, under difficult circumstances, and unsupported by
government, or by the companies pledged to encourage it, had also
failed. At the end of little more than one hundred years after Jacques
Cartier's visit to the St. Lawrence there were only 200 Frenchmen
near its waters. Of these about a hundred were fur traders, and their
employees, at once furriers and soldiers; and the rest for the greater
part were the religious, of three institutions, and their dependents.

As a further anti-colonizing influence, there was to be reckoned
with, the love of the French for their own land. The traveler and
historian, Lescarbot, himself a Frenchman and a good colonist, speaking
of colonizing had said: "If we fail, we must attribute it partly to
ourselves who are located in too goodly a land to wish to leave it, and
need be in no fear of finding a subsistence therein."

The same sentiment had prevailed up to 1641. But there had been
one element alone, which can justly claim to have had some lasting
influence and success in the colonizing movement, and that had been
the spirit of religious adventure fostered by Champlain, which made
the small garrison of Quebec into a small, but not insignificant or
undignified, centre of colonization.

We are to see this same desire to bear the light of Christianity and
civilization, as the prime moving force of the new movement to settle
in Canada, animating the founders of the new Company of Montreal, which
is now to appear.

Hence it is necessary to read into the story of the foundation of
Montreal that of the heroism of virtue and of high purpose, of
spiritual and physical endurance.

We have followed the history of Montreal from its discovery by Jacques
Cartier in 1535, to the coming of Champlain in 1603, and his choice in
1611 of La Place Royale as the site of a future settlement, ratified by
him and others for a period of many years. Still the site of the port
at the Grand Sault had never become more than an annual trading port
towards which it was the aim of the traders to push, at the opening of
navigation, to meet the natives at this most convenient spot at the end
of the Ottawa Valley.

It was reserved for the new Company of Montreal, by the powers given
it by their charter granted on December 17, 1640, to put this long
cherished idea of a permanent settlement into realization.

The various steps leading to this must now be traced. We have seen that
the Company of New France, that of the Hundred Associates or Partners,
was in possession of the country from 1627. Among other powers the
Associates had the privilege of making certain concessions, but it was
not until the death of Champlain, anticipated as we have seen during
the two months' illness and more before it occurred on Christmas day,
1635, that the privilege seems to have been used under the following
circumstances.

[Illustration: THE FOUNDATION OF MONTREAL. THE FIRST ASSOCIATES OF THE
COMPANY OF MONTREAL.

(A bas relief from the Maisonneuve Monument by Philippe Hébert)]

We have seen that Champlain had clearly meditated a settlement
at Montreal and no doubt meant to make it his own headquarters.
Circumstances had not allowed him to pursue his design. His important
position at Quebec since had left him little leisure for that in
the troublous times following. Still it is curious to note that his
fortifications placed on Ile Ronde in 1611 seemed to have given him a
lien on the site of Montreal, for we hear of no private person being
granted it till after his death in December, 1635. It is only on the
15th of January, following, that such a transaction is announced at the
annual meeting of the Hundred Associates in Paris, held in the house of
M. Jean de Lauson, the intendant of the Company.

In the edict of the establishment of this Company, in order to
facilitate the exercise of his functions, the king had ordered, that
as the whole of the members could not be expected to participate in
the active administration of its affairs, a dozen of them could be
elected directors with sole and full power under the presidency of the
intendant to buy, sell and distribute the lands.

In order to limit the powers of this executive, the eleventh article
of the edict declared that no concession of land exceeding two hundred
arpents could be valid, without the signature of twenty of the
Associates made in the presence of the intendant of the Company.

M. Lauson had been named intendant since 1627, being at that time
Councillor of State and President of the Great Council. At the annual
meeting of the Associates, on January 15, 1636, some most important
concessions were granted which affect Montreal. M. Jacques Gérard,
Chevalier, Sieur de la Chaussée, made application in due form for the
Island of Montreal. Sieur Simon le Maitre made application for the
seigneury, afterwards called de Lauson, and another, Jacques Castillon,
for that part of the Isles of Orleans called hereafter the Seigneurie
de Charny, after the name of one of de Lauson's sons. These concessions
were granted and signed by de Lauson as the intendant. Shortly
afterward when de Lauson relinquished the post of intendant, these
three, who were his friends, and had lent their names for his purpose,
transferred the properties to him. Indeed in the act of April 30, 1638,
by which M. de Chaussée ceded the "Ile de Montréal" he expressly says
that he had accepted it only to give de Lauson pleasure and to lend his
name. At the same meeting several other concessions were put through in
behalf of the eldest son of de Lauson, viz.: with the reserve of the
islands of Montreal and Orleans, all the other islands formed by the
River St. Lawrence, and the exclusive right of fishing and navigation
of the whole extent of this river. Finally, as if these islands,
without number, were not sufficient, the same eldest son received more
than sixty leagues of land facing the River St. Lawrence, beginning
from the River St. Francis, on Lake St. Pierre, and reaching up the
river to above Sault St. Louis. This concession, known hereafter under
the name of La Citière, comprised, according to the deed of possession
July 29, 1636, a part of the territory now belonging to the United
States--the whole little lot making what would have been a European
kingdom. Certainly M. de Lauson was feathering his nest and that of his
children before giving up the intendancy. There was the obligation,
however, which the Company placed on the above persons that they should
send men to the relief of the colony. This was evidently looked upon
as a legal formality, of no serious moment. Similar clauses had been
inserted in so many New France company charters already and this could
be equally disregarded, as it was. However, this illegal omission of
duty was made use of, later, as we shall see, when these concessions
were annulled and revoked by the Company of One Hundred Associates by
their ordinance of December 17, 1640.

The design of the settlement of the Island of Montreal, however, was
soon to enter into the mind of a pious, enthusiastic, and some would
say, visionary person, M. Jérome le Royer Sieur de la Dauversière, a
"receveur général des finances" at La Flèche in Anjou.

[Illustration: JEROME LE ROYER DE LA DAUVERSIERE

Founder of the La Flèche Hospitalières to serve the Hôtel Dieu at
Montreal.]

The Abbé Faillon relates the conception of this design as occurring to
the devout M. de la Dauversière when present at mass with his wife and
children on February 2, the feast of the Purification, 1635 or 1636,
when, after having received holy communion, he became convinced that
it was his duty to establish an order of lady Hospitalières, to take
St. Joseph as their patron; to establish in Montreal a Hôtel-Dieu to
be directed by these nuns; that the Holy Family should be particularly
honoured in this island; that the effect of this inspiration was a
revelation to him, as he had never conceived the project before, even
remotely; and, moreover, his knowledge of Montreal had hitherto been as
vague as that of Canada.

But Dollier de Casson, who was afterwards the parish priest of
Montreal, an old-time soldier, a learned and pious, but practical man,
although a great believer in Providence, gives a less mystical account
in his history of Montreal written from 1672 to 1673.

There he relates the origin of the design of the establishment of
Montreal as due to the reading of one of the "Jesuit Relations," which
had fallen into de la Dauversière's hands. There the writer spoke
strongly of the Island of Montreal as being the most suitable place in
the country for the purpose of establishing a mission and receiving the
savages. In reading this, M. de la Dauversière was at once much touched.

He became enthusiastic and already saw the vision of a French colony
settled at Montreal christianizing the natives. Montreal seems to
have so obsessed his mind that he was never tired of speaking of it,
depicting its position, the geography of its location, its beauty, its
fertility, its size, with such minuteness and vividness, that all who
heard him felt that he had been directly inspired with this knowledge,
for little was known of Montreal owing to the wars which had left so
little opportunity for exploring it well, that it was with difficulty
that even a rough idea of it could be furnished. De la Dauversière saw
himself called to give himself up to the conversion of the savages; but
still doubtful as to whether this idea was from God or not, he betook
himself to his Jesuit friend and confessor, Father Chauveau, rector of
the college at La Flèche.

"Have no doubt, Monsieur," was the reply. "Engage in it in good
earnest."

There was then at La Flèche under the roof of M. de la Dauversière, a
gentleman of ample means who had come to live with him "as in a school
of piety so as to learn to serve our Lord better," This was M. Pierre
Chevrier, Baron de Fancamp, who afterwards forsook the world and joined
the new order of secular priests under the name of the "Seminary of St.
Sulpice."

According to Dollier de Casson, M. Fancamp had also read with similar
emotion the same account which had influenced his friend. On his return
from the "Jesuits" M. de la Dauversière immediately related the reply
he had received and forthwith M. le Baron offered to associate himself
with him in his design and they both resolved to go to Paris together
to form some charitable body which should be ready to contribute to the
enterprise. A dramatic meeting took place there.[37]

"M. de la Dauversière," so says Dollier de Casson, "betook himself to a
mansion whither our lord conducted M. Olier." This is the celebrated M.
Olier who was afterwards the founder of the Seminary of St. Sulpice in
Paris and, indirectly, that of Montreal.

[Illustration: M. JEAN-JACQUES OLIER

Founder of Saint Sulpice in Paris and Montreal.]

Dollier de Casson continues: "These two servants of Jesus Christ
meeting in this mansion, were on a sudden enlightened by a heavenly and
altogether extraordinary gleam. They forthwith saluted one another and
embraced. They knew one another to the very depths of their souls, like
St. Francis and St. Dominic, without speaking, without anyone having
said a word to either of them, and without having previously seen one
another. After these tender embraces M. Olier said to M. Dauversière:

"I know your design. I am going to recommend it to God at the holy
altar."

This said, he left them and went to say holy mass, which M. Dauversière
heard, with a devotion altogether difficult to express when the
mind is not aglow with the same fire that consumed these great men.
Thanksgiving over, M. Olier gave M. de la Dauversière one hundred
pistoles, saying to him: "Take this then to commence the work of God!"
Thus the first interview ended.

Dollier de Casson leaves his readers to imagine with what joy and
eagerness this news is received by the "dear Baron le Fancamp." This
M. Fancamp afterwards became a priest and joined Dollier de Casson at
Montreal and no doubt he had told the first historian of Ville Marie
his story himself _per longum et latum_. Three new associates, friends
of M. Olier, were induced to finance the new venture, of whom the first
was the Baron de Renty, a man of admirable qualities, pious and filled
with apostolic zeal. These six, forming the nucleus of the Société de
Notre Dame de Montréal, determined to fit out an expedition to embark
in the spring of 1641.

But as yet they had no claim on the Island of Montreal. As we have
learned, this had been ceded to M. de la Chaussée in 1636 and
transferred to M. de Lauson in 1638, who had become the intendant of
Dauphigny where he was now residing. With daring boldness M. de la
Dauversière and M. de Fancamp, journeyed to Vienne in Dauphigny to
arrange terms with him for the cession of the island to them. De Lauson
had not colonized it, or carried out any of the conditions requiring
its being tilled, but he was not easily disposed to relinquish what was
a valuable possession for the advancement of his family, the more so as
he learned that his interests were jeopardized by the new company. He
therefore refused to discuss the question.

A second attempt and visit were made, this time with success, for M. de
la Dauversière had secured in the meantime the powerful co-operation of
Father Charles Lalemant, who had been the first Jesuit superior of the
Canadian missions, having been sent out in 1621.

Lalemant knew Canada well and had great influence with the Company of
the Hundred Associates. He had been superior of the church of Notre
Dame de Recouvrance in Quebec, as well as Champlain's confessor, and
had had naturally many official relations with M. de Lauson in his
capacity as intendant of the company. As he was held in great esteem by
M. de Lauson, Father Lalemant, who since his return from Canada two
years before was now the procurator of the missions of the society, was
a powerful advocate for the cession.

Accordingly the cession was granted by deed dated Vienne, August 7,
1640, to Pierre Chevrier, écuyer, Sieur de Fancamp, and Jérome de
Royer, Sieur de la Dauversière. This declares "that M. Jean de Lauson
cedes, has given and transferred, purely and simply the Island of
Montreal, situated on the River St. Lawrence, above Lake St. Peter,
entirely as it was given by the gentlemen of the Company of New France
to M. de la Chaussée for them and theirs to enjoy, having regard to the
same duties and conditions expressed in the act of the fifteenth of
January, 1636."

A second contract was signed, the same afternoon, by which "M. de
Lauson as much in his own name as the legitimate administrator for
Francis de Lauson, écuyer, Sieur de Lyrée, his son, yields to them the
right of navigation and passage on all the extent of the River St.
Lawrence as well as the right of fishing in this river, within ten
leagues around the Island of Montreal and that in consideration of the
great number of men which they are to cause to pass into this island to
people the colony and to aid to till the lands adjoining those of the
said Sieur de Lyrée, with the duty of giving him each year six pounds
of fish, as a token of simple acknowledgment."

In December following the general assembly of the Company of the
Hundred Associates or the "Société de Nouvelle France" was held in
Paris in the house of M. Bordier, secretary of His Majesty's council
and a former director of the Company.

The whole project of the establishment of the new company for Montreal
was discussed and its conclusions drawn up in a deed of concession,
to M. de Fancamp and M. de la Dauversière, dated December 17, 1640.
It annulled and revoked all the concessions granted by the act of
the Company dated January 15, 1636, to M. de Chaussée as well as the
concessions and transferences made thereafter of the same "pretended
rights," the whole being null and revoked through failure of the
execution of the conditions imposed within the time ordered. In the
perusal of this act we can see the relations of the two companies.
That of the Associates of Montreal is clearly regarded as a purely
religious body anxious to aid the parent body in its very great desire
to establish a strong colony in New France to instruct the savage
peoples of that place in the knowledge of God and to draw them to
civilized life. Thus they are very ready to grant them lands to aid in
this praiseworthy enterprise, to wit: etc., which are clearly defined.
In granting this they restricted the concession originally made to M.
de Chaussée of the _whole_ island by reserving to themselves the head
of the island by a line drawn from the Rivière des Prairies up to Lake
St. Louis to the distance of about four leagues from the mountain. In
compensation they granted what afterwards became known as la Seigneurie
de St. Sulpice.

"Moreover, an extent of land two leagues wide along the River St.
Lawrence by six leagues deep in the aforesaid lands, to be taken on the
north side of the same bank where the Assumption River empties into the
said St. Lawrence River, and to begin at a post which will be planted
on that same bank at a distance of two leagues from the mouth of the
same Assumption River, the rest of the said two leagues of frontage to
be taken in a direction running towards the said St. Lawrence River;
whatever lies between the Rivière des Prairies and Assumption River
and between Assumption River and the above mentioned fort, being
reserved to the said company proposing to set up thereon later as forts
and habitations."--Edits et Ord., Quebec, p. 21.

The object of the above restriction is clear. The Company of New France
was primarily a trading concern and it wished to secure its rights to
the north of Montreal as a trading centre for which it was so well
adapted by nature, as it was the natural goal of all the Indian peltry
from beyond the Sault. It reserved rights therefore to build forts and
habitations there.

It next outlined the political and municipal position of the future
colony in respect to the Company. The Sieurs Chevrier (de Fancamp), de
la Dauversière and their successors were obliged, to show their faith
and homage, to take to the fort St. Louis at Quebec in New France,
or other place afterwards designated by the Company, at each change
of possessor, as payment, a piece of gold of the weight of one ounce
stamped with the seal of the Company of New France; to present besides
other signs of acknowledgments of feudal tenure; even to furnish their
aveux et dénombrement,[38] the whole in conformity with the custom of
Paris,--a land tenure system which prevailed for so long afterward in
Canada.

In the matter of Justice, dependence was to be placed on the Sovereign
Court which was to be established at Quebec or otherwise, to which
appeal could be made from the local judges appointed by the Montreal
Company.

Montreal was, thus, crippled beforehand, in its trade extension. The
fur trade with the Indians was only allowed as far as the need and use
of private persons were concerned. All peltry, over and above this,
was to be handed over to the agents of the Company of New France at a
price fixed by it, on the pain of confiscation. Montreal's pretensions
to future independence were guarded against, by it being forbidden to
build any fortress or citadel, this privilege being reserved to the
Company should it afterward desire land for these forts and for the
settlement and housings of the officers and men around them. In case
the Company desired a fort on the mountain, it required five arpents
around it, etc. Nevertheless the seigneurs of Montreal might retrench
or fortify themselves as much as necessary to protect themselves
against the incursions of the savages.

Further limitations were placed on the sources of future population. No
grants of land were to be given to those already settled in New France,
at Quebec, Three Rivers or elsewhere, but only to those who came
expressly to people the lands. In order to insure this, the Seigneurs
Chevrier and le Royer were to send a number of men by the next shipment
made by the Company.

Finally after the clause annulling the gift of de Lauson as stated
above, the document gives order to M. de Montmagny, the governor, to
put the said seigneurs in possession of the lands.

Throughout this document there is no mention of the "Company of
Montreal." The deed is made out to the two named and to their
successors, but it was evidently understood that these were acting for
others with no other pretension than belonging to a number of
associates of the "Company of Montreal."[39]

Let us return to M. Olier. At the time we are speaking of, this young
priest, a man of less than twenty-eight years of age, was a missionary
for the country people. He had returned from these to Paris to take
a decision on a most important subject, which was, whether or not he
should accept the episcopal see of a pious prelate who had been urging
its acceptance by him for over eighteen months.

On the feast of the Purification, February 2, 1636, with this need for
decision on his mind, M. Olier having retired to the abbey church of
St. Germaies-Prés to seek in prayer the solution to his perplexity,
believed that he had received a supernatural light.

"Having prayed for some time," he relates in after years, "at morning
prayer I heard these words, 'you need to consume yourself in me, so
that I may work my whole will in you; and I wish that you may be a
light to illumine the Gentiles; _lumen ad revelationem Gentium_.'"

This appeared to him a clear call to refuse the offer of the
episcopate, which was not among the Gentiles.

At this same time his spiritual director, Père de Coudreu, the general
of the Oratorians, and the holy St. Vincent de Paul, were also thinking
out Olier's decision for him. On this same day, then, Père de Coudreu's
decision that he ought to renounce the episcopacy coming to Olier, he
believed that it was his mission to remain a simple priest, and go at
once to Canada to be allied to the Gentiles there. With difficulty he
is restrained by his director. He is all aglow with zeal, he prays
God, as his autobiographical memoirs tell, "to send me to Montreal in
Canada, where they should build the first chapel, under the title of
the Ever-Blessed Virgin and a Christian town under the name of Ville
Marie, which is a work of marvelous importance."

Olier retired towards the end of 1641, to the Village of Vaugiraud,
where he surrounded himself with some young ecclesiastics who placed
themselves under his direction.[40] Thus he founded the Seminary of
St. Sulpice, the early fruits of which were directed towards Canada.
Thus we shall see, that through his sons, he became the _lumen ad
revelationem_ of his prayers. M. Olier is therefore to be considered
one of the founders of Canada as he is already one of the first three
associates who are to form the new company of Notre Dame de Montréal.

M. Fancamp must shortly have been introduced to Olier, for we learn
that conjointly with M. Olier he sent out to Quebec in 1640, twenty
tons of provisions and tools, begging the Jesuit superior of the
mission to hold them in reserve for the reinforcement they proposed to
send to Montreal the year following before commencing the projected
establishment.

It can but be said that the concession of the Great Company was liberal
and well meaning. Indeed the same day of the concession, December 17,
1640, it engaged itself to transport on its own vessels at its own
expense, thirty men chosen by the Messieurs de Montréal as well as
thirty tons of provisions destined for their sustenance; also to write
to M. de Montmagny to give them two sites, one at the port of Quebec
and the other at Three Rivers, where they might house their provisions
in safety.

Great preparations were now the order of the day. Exhaustive plans
were prepared for the gradual development of the Colony of Montreal,
year by year ahead. Rarely has any settlement ever been thought out
so completely. It had the experience of the Colony of Quebec to fall
back upon. Quebec had its three organized institutions, its clergy
residence, its hospital and its school for the young savages. Ville
Marie should have its similar ones. In the place of the Jesuits it
should have a community of resident secular priests. This was not to
oust the Jesuits, who consented to this from the beginning, as they
wished to follow their vocation to evangelize the country far and
wide, the constitution of their order not designing them to be parish
priests. In the meantime they undertook to look after the spiritual
needs of the young settlement from their headquarters at Quebec. The
plan for the personnel to take charge of the other institutions had not
yet matured.

Documents, in the archives of the Seminary of St. Sulpice, at Paris,
relating to this period, show the fervour of those now planning "by the
goodness of God to see in a short time a new church arise which shall
imitate the purity and the charity of the primitive church."

The Associates, being in the necessity of sending out their first
consignment of men according to their agreement, it became necessary to
choose a governor, dignified, brave and wise, and a good Christian, a
man to command against the attacks of the fierce Iroquois and to build
up the civil life of the community. How the choice fell upon Paul de
Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, a gentleman of Champagne, must now be
told. Here we follow Dollier de Casson and contemporary chroniclers.
Paul de Chomedey, though still young, being commonly thought to be
within his fortieth year, had followed the career of arms since his
thirteenth year, and had given the first proofs of his courage in the
war against the Dutch. Amid the dissipations of a soldier's life,
Colonel de Maisonneuve had retained his probity and purity unsullied.
He loved his profession, but he often desired to exercise it in some
far-off country, where the gaieties and distractions in which he now
found himself a solitary man should not be forced upon him, so that he
might serve God more easily, and remain faithful to his high purposes.
Thus he was in the world but not of it. De Chomedey had a sister to
whom he was devoted, a member of the Congregation of Notre Dame at
Troyes, that ancient birthplace of warriors, poets and saints, on the
Seine. This good woman, they say, desired to partake of the romantic
and apostolic life of the Ursulines Hospitalières at Quebec, as related
by the Jesuits in their letters then being printed and circulated in
France. Doubtless by her whole-souled enthusiasm she had already
turned her brother's thoughts in the same direction of self-sacrifice.

In the dispositions, happening while visiting the house of a friend,
to put his hand by chance upon a copy of these "Relations," in turning
over the leaves he came across the name of Father Lalemant, the former
superior of the Canadian missions, whom he knew to be now in Paris. The
thought came to him that perhaps he might find congenial occupation in
Canada. Thereupon visiting the good Jesuit, he opened his heart to him.

About this same time M. de la Dauversière called upon Father Lalemant
and told him of the difficulty of the Associates in finding a suitable
leader for their enterprise.

"I know," said Lalemant, "a gentleman of Champagne who perhaps will
suit your purpose," and he advocated the qualities of his recent
visitor. He told M. de la Dauversière of the address of Maisonneuve's
hôtel. Desirous of becoming acquainted with Maisonneuve, M. Dauversière
took up his abode there also, and sought an early opportunity of
becoming casually acquainted with him at table. In order to sound him,
he placed before the guests his embarrassment in the choice of a leader
of his expedition. M. de Maisonneuve apparently did not manifest more
interest than his fellow guests at table, but on rising he took M. de
la Dauversière aside and invited him to his apartment. When alone,
Maisonneuve told him frankly of his interest in the conversation at
table. He explained in addition to his own experience in arms, that
he had a yearly income of 2,000 _livres_. "I have no view of personal
interest. I can live on my revenue, which is sufficient for me,
and I would glad-heartedly employ my purse and my life in this new
enterprise, with no other ambition but that of serving God and the
King, in my profession." If his services were agreeable to the Company
he would gladly command the expedition himself, and was ready to start
at once.

It is needless to say that such a man was a God-send to the six
associates who had only 25,000 écus, according to Dollier de Casson,
but 50,000, according to Mother Jucherau in her history of the
Hôtel-Dieu of Quebec. Preparations were made for departure. The
King, in confirming the cession of Montreal, had given power to name
its governors and to have artillery and other munitions of war. M.
Maisonneuve was appointed governor and he was charged, together with
M. de Fancamp, to prepare the equipment of provisions and implements,
etc., and to find only unmarried men, strong and able, to till the
ground, or to work at different trades, and to bear arms against the
Iroquois. M. de Maisonneuve had some difficulty in persuading his
father to give his consent to his departure. Paul was the only son, and
the only hope of his noble and ancient family, and could he wreck his
career? Paul assured him that on the contrary his reputation lay before
him in the new country. At last the father gave his willing consent.

[Illustration: PAUL DE CHOMEDEY DE MAISONNEUVE]

To Troyes Paul de Chomedey then journeyed to bid adieux to his sister,
Madame de Chuly, and to Soeur Louise de Marie, his other sister, at
the convent. There he had to refuse the offer of four of the nuns to
accompany him, to emulate at Montreal the example of the Ursulines of
Quebec. But judging the time not yet ripe for such an institution at
Ville Marie, he gave a promise that when it should be more peopled he
would employ them. His sister wrote on a statue, which they gave him
to take away as a pledge of their mutual engagement, this inscription
in letters of gold

    "Sainte mère de Dieu, pure vierge au coeur loyal,
    Gardez-nous une place en votre Montréal."

The spring had come; the expedition was ready to depart from Rochelle,
but the mother of the future colony was wanting. These hardy men needed
the solicitude and refining influence of a woman in their midst.

The call of Jeanne Mance to fill this rôle is full of romance. This
devoted lady was then about thirty-three years of age, having been
born towards the year 1606 at Nogent-le-Roi, about four leagues from
Langres, of one of the most honourable families of the district. She
was a modest girl, of great virtue, who from an early age had taken a
vow of perpetual chastity, but although she never entered the religious
life, she always nevertheless remained an unmarried lay woman. Towards
the middle of April of 1640 she had heard for the first time of the
devotedness of Madame de la Peltrie, who had just taken the Ursulines
to Quebec, and of the generosity of the Duchesse d'Aiguillon, who had
founded the house for the "Hospitalières." Though of frail health,
yet she had a daring spirit that dominated her soul so that a strong
attraction for a like sacrifice came to her. She, too, would offer
her services for Canada. Seeking advice she was told to seek Father
Lalemant in Paris. Thither she went from Langres on May 30th. She saw
Father Lalemant, but the future of the foundation of Montreal was then
uncertain, and he was then going to Dauphigny with M. Dauversière to
see M. de Lauson, as related. He could give no decided advice.

[Illustration: JEANNE MANCE

Administratrix of the first hospital in Montreal.]

Jeanne now consulted Father de St. Jure, the rector of the novitiate
of the Society of Jesus in Paris. He confirmed her in her vocation,
and she now acquainted her reluctant relatives with her firm intention
of going to the mission field of Canada. That winter, in Paris, she
visited Père Rapin, provincial of the Recollects, who entering into her
designs, introduced her to Madame de Bullion, a rich and charitable
lady, the widow of Claude de Bullion, the superintendent of finance
and keeper of the seals under Louis XIII. He was a rich man, very
worldly, clever and courageous, but he had a good heart and had endowed
a hospital for the Franciscan Cordeliers, and in which he had died on
the night of December 22-23, 1640, leaving behind him four sons and one
daughter.

When Jeanne Mance called upon the surviving widow, a few weeks later,
there was laid the foundations of a life-long friendship. At Jeanne's
fourth visit, Madame de Bullion asked her if she could undertake the
charge of a hospital which she had herself resolved to found in New
France, when opportunity occurred.

The remembrance of her frail health now made Jeanne recoil before such
a responsibility. Still, though she feared that she could not be of
much service in this regard, she left herself in the hands of God.
Nothing more was then settled. Jeanne was still determined to reach
the vessels soon about to start for New France, and on calling on
Madame de Bullion to take leave before departing to embark this good
lady gave her a purse of 1200 _livres_ to help her in her good work,
with a pledge of more to come, when Jeanne should have arrived at her
destination and had written an account of the state of affairs, as
she found them, regarding the foundation of a hospital. For many years
Madame de Bullion's name remained a secret to the colonists. Jeanne
Mance was even instructed to write to her, under cover of the name of
Père Rapin.

Neither Jeanne nor her benefactress then knew of the venture of
Montreal. This she did not learn till visiting the Jesuit La Place
at Rochelle, where she met the Baron de Fancamp who told her of its
details. The following day, Jeanne Mance met M. de la Dauversière,
whose enthusiasm made her resolve to accept his offer and that of the
Associates, to join the Montreal expedition. While they were waiting
to sail she begged M. de la Dauversière to put the plan of the new
venture into writing and to give her copies so that she might send one
with a letter in her own handwriting to Madame la Princesse de Condé,
to Madame la Chancelière, and, above all, to Madame de Bullion. These
parcels M. de la Dauversière took with him back to Paris, with fruitful
result.

All was now ready, and one of the ships had set sail. The carpenter,
upon whom they relied so much, had deserted, but on putting the vessel
back, luckily another was found on shore willing to go.

Jeanne Mance was now on her vessel.[41] Her only anxiety was that she
should be the only woman at the new settlement of Montreal, among a
good-hearted but rough body of men. Shortly before this a circumstance
occurred at Dieppe, whence the other ships of the expedition were
embarking, which gave her great joy. Two of the workmen engaged were
found to be married men, and on their refusing to go without their
wives, their condition had been accepted. In addition a young and
virtuous girl of Dieppe, seized with a sudden desire to join the
expedition, had forced her way on to the ship, against all opposition.
She too was accepted for Montreal, and Mademoiselle Mance not only
would have companions but she would find in the young girl a faithful
assistant to nurse the sick at Ville Marie.

The expedition was divided into three ships. On one was M. de
Maisonneuve with about twenty-five, including a priest, M. Antoine
Fauls, destined for the Ursulines at Quebec. On the second was Jeanne
Mance and a dozen men for Montreal with the Jesuit, Father La Place.
The third ship had sailed ahead from Dieppe with the three women spoken
of and ten men. These were the first to arrive at Quebec and they set
to work to build a store at the water's edge, at the spot directed by
M. de Montmagny, the governor. The vessel bearing Jeanne Mance reached
Quebec on August 8, 1641; that of M. de Maisonneuve did not arrive till
August 20th. After having sailed for eight days together, the vessels
were separated by the wind, for the rest of the voyage.

Great as was the joy at receiving Mademoiselle Mance at the garrison,
the delay of M. de Maisonneuve, while causing his friends uneasiness
and apprehension, gave many of the Great Company's agents at Quebec an
opportunity of further criticising the "foolhardy enterprise" (la folle
entreprise) of _Les Messieurs de Montréal_, so inauspiciously begun.

At last Maisonneuve's vessel arrived, sadly leaking and battered by
the winds which had made him thrice put back to France, causing him to
lose on the occasions three or four of his men, one of them, a most
needed man for the settlement, his surgeon. Arriving, however, at
Tadoussac, the undaunted Maisonneuve met M. de Courpon, the admiral of
the fleet of the Company of New France, one of his intimate friends.
M. de Courpon offered his own surgeon and this man straightway gaily
accepting, put his belongings on board. Against all expectation
Maisonneuve's vessel sailed into Quebec on August 20th.[42]

On arriving at Quebec, Maisonneuve must have found himself the centre
of anxious thoughts and criticisms. Jeanne Mance would have told him of
this. He would soon gauge public opinion on his official visits.

It would have been the governor of Quebec that Maisonneuve visited
first. To Governor Montmagny, the position of Maisonneuve was, at
least, strange. Quebec was designed to be the seat of government as
the act of December 17, 1640, had clearly marked out. Montreal was to
derive her power from it. Yet Maisonneuve came with the governor's
commission for Montreal and power from the King himself, to have
artillery, munitions of war and soldiers, and a right to appoint
officers of the future colony on a basis of home rule. Both men must
have scented a future clash at Montreal. Yet hostility must not be
read too quickly into Montmagny's action. He was a gentleman and a
broadminded man although he was one of those who thought the expedition
"a foolish enterprise." Dollier de Casson has recorded the result of
this interview. Montmagny's words were:

"You know that the war with the Iroquois has recommenced, and that they
declared it last month at Lake St. Peter, in a fashion that makes them
appear more active than ever against us. You cannot then, reasonably,
think of settling in a place so far removed from Quebec as Montreal.
You must change your resolution; if you wish it, you will be given the
Island of Orleans, instead. Besides, the season would be too advanced
for you to be able to settle at Montreal before the winter, even had
you thought of so doing."

M. Maisonneuve's reply was dignified and calm.

"What you say sir, would be good, if they had sent me to Canada to
deliberate on the choice of a suitable post, but the Company which
sends me, having determined that I shall go to Montreal, my honour is
at stake, and you will not take it ill that I proceed thither to start
a colony. But owing to the season being so far advanced, you will take
it kindly if I am satisfied to go with the more active young men, to
reconnoitre this post before winter, so as to see in what place I can
encamp next spring with all my party."

Maisonneuve's next visit would have been to the clergy represented
by Father Vimont, superior of the Jesuits. Strong in influence with
the Company, his views are worth recording. For this we must fall
back on the "Relations." The Jesuits in France had promoted the new
settlement of Montreal. In the past the writers of the "Relations"
had foreseen the need of utilizing the position at the Sault for a
permanent centre for religious activities, and this meant a settled
garrison to withstand the inroads of the fury and impetuosity of the
Iroquois. Yet of late, the perilous position of the tottering garrison
of Quebec had been so patent that they felt that concentration was the
policy of the hour. As a result of the interview Father Vimont wrote
this year to France: "We have received pleasure at the sight of the
gentlemen of Montreal because their design, if it is successful, is
entirely to the Glory of our God. M. de Maisonneuve, who commands these
men, has arrived so late that he will have wisdom enough, not to ascend
higher than Quebec for this year; but God grant that the Iroquois close
not the way, when there is question of advancing further.... Some
one will say," he continues, "this enterprise is full of expense and
difficulties; these gentlemen will find mountains where they expect to
find valleys. I will not say to these gentlemen that they will find the
roads strewn with roses; the cross, suffering, and great outlays are
the foundation stones of the house of God.... But patience will put the
last touch to this great work."

We may imagine de Maisonneuve's conversation with this serious
sympathizer would have been on these lines and his courage would not
have been diminished.

In spite of de Maisonneuve's firm resolution, Montmagny still hoped
to win him over. He called a meeting of the principal inhabitants
to consider the position. It was a question of concentration or
disintegration--the Island of Orleans under the shadow of Quebec; or
Montreal, 180 miles away in advance of civilization, at the mercy
of the hostile Iroquois? It was a serious question for "la colonie
française."

When the meeting assembled, and before anything had been decided, de
Maisonneuve spoke like a man of courage and one accustomed to the
profession of a soldier. He explained that he had not come to settle
in the Island of Orleans, but to lay the foundation of a town on the
Island of Montreal, and that even should this project be more perilous
than they had told him it was, he would carry it on, should it cost him
his life. "I am not come to deliberate," he concluded, "but to act.
Were all the trees on the Island of Montreal to be changed into so
many Iroquois it is a point of duty and honour for me to go there and
establish a colony."

The meeting broke up without any further deliberation. The clear and
courageous expression of the governor of Montreal had won the day.

Dollier de Casson tells us that Montmagny was gained over by this
straight-forward speech. He was a Chevalier of the Order of St. John of
Jerusalem, a soldier and a gentleman. He put no further opposition, but
was anxious to put the governor of Montreal in possession of his post
according to the instructions from his Company.

On October 10th, he, himself, with Father Vimont and others, left
Quebec, and arrived with de Maisonneuve at Montreal, on October 14th.
The customary formalities of taking possession were concluded on
October 15th. The site chosen was that we know as La Place Royale.

On his way down to Quebec, de Maisonneuve stayed a day with a venerable
old man, M. Pierre de Puiseaux, Sieur de Montrenault, who had built a
house at a post called Ste. Foy. This house, as well as that of St.
Michel, at which Madame de la Peltrie was living, he generously offered
to Maisonneuve, together with all his farm stock and furniture, for
the use of the expedition. This unexpected gift Maisonneuve accepted
only conditionally on its acceptance being ratified by the Company
of Montreal. The offer of St. Michel,[43] which was then considered
the bijou house of Canada, was most opportune for M. de Maisonneuve,
besides having quarters for the winter time for Mademoiselle Jeanne
Mance, Madame de la Peltrie, who had associated herself with the
Montreal project, and himself, might with M. de Puiseaux superintend
the necessary preparations for the voyage, while at Ste. Foy, at which
he had left the surgeon and the carpenters, the oaks were being cut
down, and barks were being constructed large enough to carry the party
and all their effects to Montreal.

Meanwhile, the care of the stores for all the Montreal party, during
this winter of 1641-2, was under the skillful management of Jeanne
Mance, who endeared herself to all. Moreover the colonists learned to
know one another and their future governor, who went among them day by
day, encouraged them. It seemed already Montreal. Soon de Maisonneuve's
feast day, the Conversion of St. Paul, coming round on January 25th,
Paul de Chomedey gave his men a little feast in honour of the occasion.
The men fired salutes from the artillery they had brought.

Nearby, in Quebec, the noise of the cannon was heard. Its governor,
touchy for his official prerogatives, interpreted this as an
infringement of his dignity, and he caused Jean Gorry, who had fired
the cannon, to be seized and imprisoned. On the first day of February
Jean Gorry being now released, Maisonneuve gave a feast and paid
particular honour to the unfortunate Jean. The governor of Montreal
knew that Montmagny had exceeded his power, but it was not then the
time to provoke an open quarrel.

Montmagny heard of this second exploit and summoned several of
Maisonneuve's men, who had been present at the feast, to testify on
oath what had happened. The affair blew over, and the governors resumed
pleasant relations, probably because Montmagny found that he was in
the wrong and had read a petty challenge in the harmless salute which
was quite permissible under the commission, given by the king to the
governor of Montreal, for his men to bear arms. Still this incident is
significant and worth recording, in view of the friction and jealousy
to arise between the future governors of the rival cities of Quebec and
Montreal.


FOOTNOTES:

[36] Ville Marie is the name of the town appearing in all the official
documents till 1705, when for the first time that of Montreal appears.
Montreal, in the form of the "Island of Montreal," had, however, been
used long before. The document containing the transition from Ville
Marie to Montreal has been recently brought to public attention by Mr.
E. Z. Massicotte, city archivist.

[37] It was in one of the galleries of the "Château de Meudon" where
the two unexpectedly met. Dauversière, it is thought, had gone there
to the keeper of the seals who was then at the palace. The second
conference after Thanksgiving was in the park grounds of the château
and lasted three hours. (Cf. Faillon.)

[38] Consisted in an avowal of the grant of the seigneury from
the Crown and the census of the seigneury with the names of the
concessionaires, the amount of the lands granted them and under
cultivation, together with the number of heads of cattle, etc.

[39] In fact both of these swore to this explicitly before the notaries
of the King, Pourcelle and Chaussiere, on March 25, 1644. (Edits et
Ord., Quebec I, pp. 26-27.) On March 21, 1650, there was also signed an
act by the Associates which gave to the last survivor, excluding all
heirs, the forts, habitations, etc., conceded to the members of the
Company of Montreal. (Edits et Ord., p. 27.)

[40] "La Compagnie de Prêtres de St. Sulpice" was founded at Vaugirard,
near Paris, in January, 1642, by M. Jean Jacques Olier de Verneuil, who
was born in Paris on September 20, 1608, and died April 2, 1657. The
establishment of the seminary at St. Sulpice, in Paris, was commenced
on August 15, 1642. It was erected into a community on October 23,
1645, and was confirmed by letters patent by Cardinal Chighi, legate a
latere for France.

[41] For Jeanne Mance's future assistants de la Dauversière had
established, in 1639, a young community of "Filles Hospitalières" at
La Flèche, although it had been in existence elsewhere since 1636, who
were to prepare themselves for the Hôtel-Dieu of Ville Marie. The order
at La Flèche was erected on October 25, 1643, by Mgr. Claude de Rueil,
bishop of Angers, and approved by Pope Alexander VII by a brief of
January 19, 1666. The Sisters for Montreal did not arrive till 1659.

August 20th, Sister Morin for October, Montgolfier for September. The

During the months of February, March and April, the boat construction
went busily on at Ste. Foy. At length when the ice-bound river
broke up and the last floes had swept past to the gulf beyond, M.
de Maisonneuve's flotilla, loaded with provisions, furniture and
tools, besides little pieces of artillery and ammunition, set sail to
Montreal on May 8th. It consisted of a pinnace, a little vessel with
three masts, a gabarre or flat-bottomed transport barge with sails,
and two barques or chaloupes. On one of these latter M. de Montmagny,
the governor of Quebec, fittingly led the way with M. de Maisonneuve;
with the expedition were several black-robed Jesuits, including Father
Barthélemy Vimont, the superior of the Canadian mission, and Father
Poncet, the first missionary for Ville Marie. There were also M. de
Puiseaux, Madame de la Peltrie, and her maid, Charlotte Barré, Jeanne
Mance, and the rest of the twenty-one colonists, six of whom belonged
to the household of Nicholas Godé, the joiner.

On the 17th, as evening fell, they came in sight of Montreal and
cantiques rent the air. On this day M. Montmagny again[44] put M. de
Maisonneuve formally in possession of the island. Setting sail early
next morning, before daybreak, the rising sun delighted their eyes with
the beautiful meadows smiling with a profusion of flowers of variegated
colours. At last they reached the islet at the mouth of the stream,
which, so long ago, Champlain spoke of as a safe haven, until they
reached hard by the spot named by him, _La Place Royale_. Within this
watered mead, de Maisonneuve had decided to build his settlement and
fort. As he put foot to the soil, inspired by the solemnity of the
moment, lie fell on his knees in thanksgiving to God, and was quickly
followed by all his party. They broke forth into heartfelt psalms
or hymns of joyful gratitude. In the meadow, a spot was chosen for
the mass of thanksgiving. Quickly the altar was arranged under the
direction of Mademoiselle Mance and Madame de la Peltrie. When all were
gathered round it in this open air temple,--the silence only broken
by the twittering of the numerous birds, the flapping of wings of the
wild fowl and their shrill cries as they winged their flight above
the river to the south, the sighing of the trees; the swish of the
meadow plants swaying in the morning breeze and the murmuring of the
little haven-stream on which the chaloupes were tossing; the subdued,
sonorous rush of the water on the mighty St. Lawrence at its mouth,
where the pinnace and gabare were riding at anchor,--the superior of
the missions of Canada, Father Vimont, intoned the grand old solemn
chant of Christian ritual, the _Veni Creator Spiritus_, and the voices
of all joined in with heartfelt unison. Then followed the Grand Mass,
the first that had ever been celebrated at Villa Marie,[45] and all the
while the growing sun shone full upon the slopes of Mount Royal, ever
mounting upward and onward to its wooded peak.

[Illustration: THE COLONISTS' MEMORIAL]

The scene is one of life and colour. The rich hues of the vestments of
the priests, the shining white linen of the altar, the gleaming sacred
ornaments, the picturesque costumes of Montmagny and de Maisonneuve,
the ladies and gentlemen around them, the varied dresses of the
artisans and the arquebusiers, whose weapons glint in the sun, fill in
a picture worthy of the mountain background, such as should inspire any
artist's brush.

And now the action of the Sacrifice was suspended and Father Vimont
broke the sice and earnestly spoke to the worshippers. His words
have become famous, pregnant as they were with prophetic meaning. We
thank Dollier de Casson for having preserved them.

"That which you see, gentlemen, is only a grain of mustard seed, but it
is cast by hands so pious and so animated with faith and religion, that
it must be that God has great designs for it, since He makes use of
such instruments for His work. I doubt not, but that this little grain
may produce a great tree, that it will make wonderful progress some
day, that it will multiply itself, and stretch out on every side."

[Illustration: VIMONT'S PROPHECY. THE FIRST MASS ON THE SITE OF
MONTREAL]

Never was prophecy more true, when we realize the present greatness of
Montreal and remember the distinguished sons and daughters it has sent
over the world. For Montreal has been the home of great discoverers,
religious founders, missionaries and pioneers of civilization, and
captains of industry. It is the mother of the cities of the northwest
and its future is still before it.

The mass ended, the Sacred Host is left exposed throughout the day,
as though the island were a cathedral shrine. For a sanctuary lamp
the women, not having any oil, placed with pious zeal a number of
"fireflies" in a phial, which, as evening stole on, shone like little
clusters of tapers in the vesper gloom.

Next morning the actuaries of an encampment occupied all. Around
the temporary altar, the camp tents were pitched, a chapel of bark
was constructed,[46] and trees were cut down to surround the colony
with an intrenchment of stakes and a ditch, the governor, Montmagny,
felling the first tree, after which he proceeded to Quebec. But Madame
de la Peltrie and M. de Puiseaux remained. On August 15th the first
reinforcement of thirteen men arrived, sent under M. de Repentigny, as
admiral of the Company's vessels by the Associates at Paris, through
the funds collected, as mentioned, on February 2d. With them there came
a most useful man to the colony, the pious and brave carpenter, Gilbert
Barbier, surnamed "Minimus" for his short stature. Altar, furniture
and other valuables arrived, and Gilbert Barbier immediately set about
constructing a worthy chapel of wood, while wings were added to make
the mission settlement house.

Meanwhile, during the summer, the vessels plied between Yule Marie
and St. Michel to bring up the rest of the stores and ammunition left
behind. These reduced the guard to but a score of men, but as yet, the
Iroquois had not got scent of the new settlement. On August 15 the
new chapel was completed and used for service--a framework building
of about ten feet square which did service as a conventual and quasi
parochial chapel till the beginning of 1659.[47]

So passed the happy days unmolested by any foe. A friendly band of
Algonquins visited the camp and after witnessing a religious procession
on Assumption day, 1642, journeyed with the governor to the summit
of Mount Royal. While there, it is related that two of their body,
aged men, told the bystanders that they belonged to the race formerly
inhabiting this island. Stretching out their arms to the slopes on the
west and the south sides of the mountain they exclaimed: "Behold the
places where once there were villages flourishing in numbers, whence
our ancestors were driven by our enemies. Thus it is that this island
became deserted and uninhabited." "My grandfather," said one old man,
"tilled the earth at this place. The Indian corn grew well then." And
taking up the soil in his hands: "See the richness of it," he cried,
"how good it is!" Charmed with this discourse they were pressed to stay
and live happily with their friends, the white men, but the wandering
habits of these forest children finally prevailed.

In the month of December, the safety of the colony was threatened by
the floods of the St. Lawrence which advanced over the low lying lands
towards the fort. With simple faith, M. Maisonneuve planted a cross
over against the invading waters, and the "Relations" of this year,
tell how the floods receded on Christmas day.

In pious gratitude M. Maisonneuve would erect a permanent cross on the
mountain. A trail was blazed and cut, and on the feast of the Epiphany,
January 6, 1643, a procession formed, M. Maisonneuve leading, carrying
the cross on his shoulders and followed by others bearing the wood
for its pedestal. On reaching the summit, Père Duperon had an altar
erected, and celebrated mass after the cross had been blessed and
erected. At this time, there seemed to have been two priests attached
to the mission. This was the origin of the annual pilgrimage, since
discontinued. On the feast of St. Joseph, March 19, 1643, the main
building, or the Habitation, containing the chapel of Notre Dame, the
stores, and dwelling rooms for sixty persons, was completed. In front
they placed the small pieces of artillery and then celebrated the
occasion with a cannonade.

The life within resembled that of a religious community. For the most
part they lived in common, offering a picture of the fervour and
simplicity of the primitive church. Closed up for nearly eleven years
for mutual safety within the fort, they learned to live a life of
charity and holiness. The days were as yet uneventful, and the round
of work and prayer and recreation bound them together in peace and
comfort. Not only the governor and the leaders of the settlement, but
all the rough soldiers and workmen led a fervent and exemplary life.
The hand of obedience pressed lightly on them, and a willing service
was granted by all. The "Relations" of the annals of this period are
full of praise of the sanctity and peace of these early days. "One
saw," says Sister Morin in the Annales of the Hôtel-Dieu, "no public
sins, nor enmities, nor bitternesses; they were united in charity, ever
full of esteem and affection one for another, and ready to serve one
another on all occasions."

The ideal of the pious Associates of the Company of Notre Dame de
Montreal at Paris was being fulfilled.

The governor, in his apostolic zeal, established confraternities among
the men and women, for the conversion of the savages, for this was the
motive that had inspired the foundation of this far off outpost of
civilization.

The singleness of purpose of the settlers at Montreal was not lost upon
the Hurons, who spoke of it to their different tribes, so that many now
began to arrive. In February of 1643 a band of Algonquin braves came
by, leaving their wives and children in camp while they went forth on
the warpath against their enemies, the Iroquois. A few days later they
were visited by Algonquin hunters, for there was much sport around.
The chief of this band stayed behind with his wife, desirous to live
a civilized life, and the parish register records their baptism and
their Christian marriage, on March 7th, of that year, the first to be
recorded in the marriage book. Soon, this was followed by the baptism
of the wife and children of his uncle, a famous orator among the
Algonquins, who was known as "Borgne de l'Ile." The registers finally
record his baptism and his Christian marriage.

Montreal was soon to experience the effects of the alliance of the
Hurons with the French, as well as some of the disasters prophesied
by Montmagny to Maisonneuve at Quebec, from the war which had been
declared a month before Maisonneuve's arrival. Other parts of the
country had already been suffering. In 1642 Father Vimont in the
"Relations" had written that the Iroquois had sworn a cruel war against
the French. They blocked up all the passage of our great river,
hindering commerce and menacing the whole country with ruin.

On the 2d of August, 1643, at Three Rivers, an attack was made by them
on the fort and they killed or took prisoners a party of twenty-three
to twenty-eight Huron allies, and with them the heroic and saintly
Jesuit, Isaac Jogues, and two young Frenchmen. The saintly Jogues was
subjected to much in treatment. After having cut off the thumb of his
right hand and bitten off one of his fingers, they tore his nails out
with their teeth, and put fire under the extremities of his mutilated
fingers. Having done this they tore off his cassock and clothed him in
the garb of a savage. Though he escaped, he was reserved for a martyr's
death, on October 18, 1646, among the Onondagas. The year previously he
had ministered to the infant church at Montreal.

At the new fort on the Iroquois River, designed by Montmagny, on August
13, 1643, the Iroquois swept down after seven days, and captured some
prisoners whom they told that 700 of them were banding together and
would fall upon the French colony in the beginning of next spring.

Great fear for Montreal, the solitary and most advanced port, was
entertained in the spring at Quebec. Still this concerted attack was
not yet to be realized. Yet the immunity of Montreal was not to last
long.

There was a method in the madness of the Iroquois. They hated the
French because of their alliance with the Christian Hurons and they did
their best to cut off the peltry trade of the Northwest from them and
divert it to Albany and New Amsterdam. This naturally suited the Dutch.
To carry this plan out, the Iroquois, small in numbers but expert
military tacticians, had established an uninterrupted line of lookout
posts from Three Rivers to the portage of the Chaudières (Ottawa).
Starting from this as their working point, they divided their fighting
men into ten sections, two of which remained at this exposed post. The
third section was stationed at the foot of the Long Sault, the fourth
above Montreal, the fifth on the island, the sixth on the Rivière des
Prairies, the seventh on Lac St. Pierre, the eighth not far from Fort
Richelieu on the Sorel, the ninth near Three Rivers, while the tenth
formed a flying squadron to carry devastation when the opportunity
presented itself. Few could break past them in safety. Even Jogues had
not been successful.

Soon the number of baptisms registered for this year reached the number
of seventy or eighty. These were busy days for the few ladies of
Montreal.[48]

The frequent visitations of the savages were a drain on the stores of
the community, and we learn from Dollier de Casson that in the spring
of 1644 more serious efforts were made under d'Ailleboust to raise
wheat. To the delight of all, this was abundantly successful. Up to
1643 only vegetables had been cultivated.

Thus passed the peaceful days along, for though there was much hardship
incidental to a pioneering life in a new country so far removed from
communication with civilization, still, all were happy, since so far
the dreaded Iroquois had not appeared. But in July of that year, 1643,
a friendly troupe of Algonquins passed by. There was great joy in the
camp, for it was the occasion of the baptism of the four-year-old child
of one of the chiefs. M. Maisonneuve and Jeanne Mance were happy to be
its godparents. The Indians were invited to return with their families
next spring, and live with them. They promised to do so. No doubt they
told others of their trip, for the colony was again shortly visited.[49]

The Hurons came to be regarded by the Iroquois as the allies of the
hated white men. The establishment of the fort of Montreal was an
additional reason for exterminating the Hurons. In consequence the
register of baptism, for the year of 1644, only records one ceremony.
This is significant, for it marked the presence in the neighbourhood
at last of the dreaded Iroquois, who kept the Hurons from visiting
this year. The circumstance of the presence of the Iroquois in the
neighbourhood became known to this fort one day in 1643, when a
party of ten Algonquins ran terror-stricken into camp, trembling and
afraid of their shadows. Outside the fort were the baffled pursuers
too small in numbers to attack it. One of their tribe had been slain
by the fugitive Algonquins, who had directed their steps to friendly
shelter without being overtaken. From that time forward, there was
dread of Iroquois surprises in the camp. It was now at last discovered;
stealthily and noiselessly the balked enemy reconnoitered the camp and
retired to the woods to spread the news to the tribe and to prepare
for an attack. For, unknown to the fort, the country was infested with
them--sworn to make war upon the French. In June, a party of them were
at Lachine, being joined by a party of unarmed Hurons whom they had
surprised with their canoes laden with peltry. The treacherous Hurons,
who had been in the past kindly received at the fort, to conciliate
their captors, now pointed it out to them for an attack.

Unsuspecting any attack, six men from the fort, cutting wood about two
hundred feet distant, were surprised by forty Iroquois on the 9th of
June. They fought bravely; but three were killed and the rest taken
prisoners. The body of Guillaume Boissier _dit_ Güilling was found that
day and buried but the bodies of Bernard Berté from Lyons and Pierre
Laforest _dit_ L'Auvergnat were not found till later, and were buried
three days after by Father Davost.

The archæologist will be pleased that the place of the first cemetery
is recorded by the chroniclers. At the corner of the angle of the
meadow, where the River St. Pierre joined the St. Lawrence, a little
cemetery was made and fenced around with piles[50] to save the dead from
molestation.

On the day after, some of the treacherous Hurons fled into the camp and
told the awful tale of slaughter committed by the Iroquois during the
night. The Hurons had spent the night insulting the French prisoners
until sleep had closed their eyes, when the Iroquois fell upon them and
slashed to pieces those who could not escape. Then taking the thirteen
Huron canoes they loaded them with peltry; they descended the river
with the three French prisoners in the sight of the onlookers of the
fort, who were too few to pursue them.

What happened to the prisoners was graphically told later when one of
them arrived at the camp.

He told how the design of his captors had been to descend to a point
whence they could land and cut their way through the woods, to the
place now known as Chambly. But having too heavy a load of beaver skins
to carry, on landing they destroyed their canoes with their axes, as
their custom was to render them useless.

When they were in the woods, some four or five leagues from the place
whence they left the river, their care of their prisoners became less
guarded. He had been set to boil a kettle, and taking the opportunity
of being sent to gather wood for the fire, he had eluded his captors
and had come to the spot where he had landed. Finding one of the canoes
less damaged than the others, he plugged up the dents made by the
Iroquois hatchets, and loading it with a few skins, had then paddled
up to Ville Marie. The soldiers of the fort went for the rest of the
peltries and M. de Maisonneuve distributed them, but kept none fur
himself.[51] The fate of the other two prisoners was told later by a
Huron who escaped from the Iroquois. We are not told their names by the
"Relations" of 1643, but one whose Christian name was Henri, having
seen his companion, as well as two Hurons, burnt at a slow fire, had
escaped, only to be recaptured for the same terrible fate.

For the rest of that year, apprehension of ambuscades kept the colony
within the walls of the fort as far as possible. Even to leave the
threshold of their homes was to risk danger.

"Tant il est vrai," adds M. Dollier de Casson, "que dans ces temps
on était plus en assurance de ce qu'on avait franchi le seuil de sa
porte." From this time begins the history of "Castle Dangerous," as we
may term this period of the _nascent city_, now commencing, when there
began a constant struggle with the daily risks of life. It was during
this early anxiety that good news came to allay some of the alarm, and
this was brought by the governor of Quebec.

For, meanwhile in France, during the winter, the eyes of many were
turned onto the infant colony. Praise and criticism alike were freely
distributed. The great Company, stung by reflections on their own
inactivity, repented of having given their charter to a company which
they feared might prove a rival, and would have revoked it, but for
the ratification it had received from the King. There were many,
however, who in high places strongly approved of the aims and objects
of the Company of Montreal.[52] A letter is extant, from Louis XIII
himself, written at St. Germain-en-Laye, on February 21st, which was
written to M. Montmagny, the agent of the Great Company at Quebec,
bidding him "assist and favour in every way in his power, the Seigneur
de Maisonneuve in such manner that there shall be no trouble or
hindrance." This was one of the last acts of this noble prince, who
died on May 24th following, but his kindness to Montreal will always be
remembered. It was he who gave the Company of Montreal besides presents
of artillery the vessel of 250 tons, which, under the name of Notre
Dame de Montréal, was now crossing the ocean bringing new colonists and
their effects.

In the month of July, 1643, the colony was delighted with the presence
of M. Montmagny, who announced the approaching convoy sent by the
Associates, under the guidance of one who was destined to be an
able lieutenant to M. Maisonneuve. This was M. Louis d'Ailleboust,
Seigneur de Coulonges, a man of an illustrious family that had given
distinguished sons to the church and state. The vessels, bringing
him and his party of colonists for Montreal, arrived at Quebec on
Assumption day, 1643, and soon they reached the fort. Among them,
to the great delight of Jeanne Mance, was his noble lady, Barbe de
Boulogne. Jean de Saint-Père, the first notary, was also with them. For
Jeanne Mance, M. d'Ailleboust brought a message, of which we shall hear
later. M. d'Ailleboust was a skillful engineer, and under his guidance
the wooden stockade was reinforced with two bastions, which the fear of
attacks from the Iroquois had rendered most desirable. This enclosure
now began to be called the "Fort" or the "Château."

The religious care of the colony at this time was that exercised by
the Jesuit Fathers,[53] whose headquarters were at Quebec. As we have
seen, they willingly consented to serve this mission until M. Olier had
prepared for the Associates a succession of secular priests formed by
his hand for the special purpose of Montreal. The time was now come for
M. Olier's company to leave Vaugirard, to which he had gone in 1641,
and to follow him to Paris to the parish of St. Sulpice, where he was
now training in his Seminary of St. Sulpice, a goodly number of young
priests suitable for the Canadian mission of Ville Marie. These were
ready to go, but as yet a technical difficulty of ecclesiastical canon
law stood in the way.

Since the re-occupation of Quebec by the French in 1632, after the
departure of the English under Kerth, the Jesuits had been sent under
the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Rouen, and this see had continued
to claim the Catholics of New France as its diocesans.

To M. Olier it appeared that Canada, being a foreign mission, the
privilege of sending clergy belonged directly to Rome; accordingly the
Associates of Montreal addressed a letter to Pope Urbain VIII, asking
him to authorize the papal nuncio then in Paris to give the ordinary
powers of missioners, to those whom they would send to Ville Marie.

This document, preserved in the archives of Versailles, contains,
in addition to the above request, others asking for certain routine
grants and privileges. The answer from Rome, while granting the
latter, ignored the main request. There seemed to be no desire at
present, at Rome, to conflict with the privileges of Rouen, or with the
prescriptive rights of the Jesuits. Then too there was opposition then
being threatened by the Great Company. Matters, therefore, stood where
they were.

Indeed any other course taken at this time would have been very unwise.
Especially as the state of feeling of unrest reflected in France this
year by the "véritables motifs" was doubtless known at the Vatican
through the papal nuncio, who was at this period in Paris, as we have
seen.

Before passing from the events of 1643, notice must be taken of a
remarkable document which appeared in Paris this year. This was "Les
Véritables Motifs," one of the historical documental sources of this
early period.

It was published in a volume of 127 pages in quarto, very likely having
been printed in Paris, but bearing no names of place, printer or
author. M. l'abbé Faillon, the author of "La Colonie Française," thinks
it was written by a former judge, M. Laisné de la Marguerie, who had
left the world to associate himself with M. Olier. On the contrary,
however, the abbé Verreau thinks that it is the production of M. Olier
himself, for reasons which we prefer to follow.

The full title of the book, "Véritables Motifs de Messieurs et Dames
de la Société de Notre Dame de Montréal, pour la Conversion des
Sauvages," is an indication at once, of an apologia for the erection
of the Montreal mission for the conversion of the infidels. It seems
strange in these days that such self-defence should be necessary.
But the document reveals that there was strong opposition to, and
misunderstanding of, the "raison d'être" of a purely religious colony.
We may suspect that the objections formulated must have been from the
Company of New France in a spirit of jealousy.

The chief objections were (1) That it was contrary to the established
custom of the Catholic church to have lay people, and especially
ladies, enterprising a mission for the conversion of infidels.

(2) That this work was not needed for the salvation of the heathen,
as they argued in the case of infidel peoples in the absence of
revelation, they were invincibly ignorant, and that the light of reason
alone sufficed for their salvation.

(3) That the work of the Associates was a piece of ostentatious piety;
that in the past it had sufficed for pious people to give their alms
secretly to be administered by others for the good of religion. There
was no need to establish a company for the purpose.

(4) That this Company injured the interests of others, viz: the Company
of the Hundred Associates, the Jesuits, who had been given the charge
of the Canadian missions, and finally the poor of France, for charity
begins at home.

(5) That the Association of Montreal, not having any other foundation
but that of Christian charity, it is bound to be a financial failure,
and that the enterprise would fall through, owing to lack of enthusiasm
and consequent shortage of funds.

(6) Finally, that the enterprise was ill considered, badly planned
and rash; that South America would have been a better place for such
a settlement; that Montreal was unfitted for French people to live in
on account of the cruel cold and the excessive length of the winter;
that they would be more exposed than ever to the butcheries of the
Iroquois, who would infallibly cut them into pieces; that a work of
such consequence could only be carried on by the King's government on
account of the enormous expenses entailed, and it was folly for private
persons to dare to tempt God openly.

The answer to these objections is continued in the 127 pages of quarto
alluded to. We will leave them to the imagination. Without giving the
reply we need only refer the reader to the year 1643 and the practical
solution now going on at Montreal in the year of 1914.[54]

On the 2d of February, another scene in the romantic story of Montreal
was enacted in Paris in the Church of Notre Dame. There at six o'clock
in the morning Olier said mass at the altar of the Holy Virgin,
surrounded by the members of the Association of Montreal, who now had
reached as many as thirty-five. The lay members, many of distinguished
rank, (for Jeanne Mance's letter on her departure to M. Dauversière
had helped in this), communicated, while the priests celebrated at
neighbouring altars in the vast cathedral.

They consecrated the Island of Montreal to the Holy Family and placed
it particularly under the protection of Mary, whose name they gave to
the city of "Ville Marie," and from that day the seal of the Associates
bore the Virgin's statue with the legend "Notre Dame de Montréal." On
this day the Associates gave a sum of 40,000 _livres_, to be devoted to
defray the expenses of a new expedition.

NOTE

THE HURONS, ALGONQUINS AND IROQUOIS


HURONS

The Hurons were the Wendots or Wyandots, and were divided into various
clans or families, such as the Bears, the Rocks, the Cords, etc.
They were the parent stock of the five Iroquois Nations and were
related to the Petuns and Neutrals, their neighbours on Lake Huron,
or Attegouestan, as they called it. They were also connected by blood
with the Undastes or Susquehannas of Pennsylvania. The derivation of
the name of Hurons, as the Wyandots were called by the French, is
fanciful but apparently authentic. When Champlain, in 1609, was visited
at Quebec by a tribe of these Wyandots to sell peltry from the far-off
Northwest regions, the irregular tufts of hair on their half-shaven
heads seemed to the Frenchman to represent bristles (_la hure_) on
the back of an angry boar. "Quelle hure!" they exclaimed, and those
possessing the stock of bristles they called "Hurons."

Their country was eight hundred or nine hundred miles away from Quebec,
around Lake Huron. "Roughly speaking," says the Rev. T. J. Campbell in
his "Pioneer Priests of North America," "the territory of the Hurons
was at the head of Georgian Bay, with Lake Simcoe on the east, the
Severn River and Matchedash Bay on the north, Nottawasaga Bay on the
west, and was separated from the Neutrals on the south by what would
now be a line drawn from the present town of Collingwood over to
Hawkstone on Lake Simcoe. The train for Toronto, north of Midland and
Penetanguishena, runs through the old habitat of the Hurons."

Many of the clergy who served Montreal had laboured among them. In the
beginning the Hurons would not listen to any allusion to Christianity.
Success only began in 1639, and lasted but for ten years, for before
the end of 1650 as a distinct people they had vanished, being
exterminated by their implacable foe, the Iroquois.


THE ALGONQUINS

The Algonquins are said to derive their name from the word Algonquin,
"the place where they spear the fish," i. e., the front of the canoe.

They were once a great race. Indeed today they number 95,000 of
which 35,000 are in the United States and the rest in Canada. Their
hereditary enemy, the Iroquois, were not so numerous, and thus we
find Champlain allying himself with the Algonquins against the scanty
sixteen or seventeen thousand Iroquois who lived in the New York
territory. But herein lay Champlain's mistake. The Algonquins were
wanderers and not warriors. They were a simple, stupid people, who
neither cultivated the ground nor learned any textile arts and had
no settled habitations. They were all worshipers of the Manitou,
shameless in their immoralities and just as cruel to their captives,
as were the Iroquois. They were, owing to their nomadic life, a prey
to the latter and a difficulty to the few missionaries to Christianize
them adequately, for every group would have necessitated a priest to
follow them in the hunt for game or fish, as they wandered from place
to place.

Yet, portions of them, being less fierce than other tribes of their
race, welcomed the missionaries, who sympathized with them in their
poverty and wretchedness. Thus at Montreal, as at Three Rivers and
Quebec, these were the basis of the Indian converts.

"When the Algonquins were a great nation they claimed," says the author
of the "Pioneer Priests of North America," "as their own, almost all
the upper regions of the North American continent, and even out in the
Atlantic there was no one to dispute Newfoundland with them, except an
inconsiderable and now forgotten people, known as the Beothuken. Cape
Breton, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, and all the country from
Labrador to Alaska was theirs, except where the Esquimaux lived in the
East, the Kitunabaus in the far Northwest, and the Hurons, Petuns and
Neutrals in the region near Georgian Bay. In what is now the United
States, New England was counted as their country, and though their
deadly enemy, the Iroquois, had somehow or other seized the greater
portion of New York, yet the strip along the Hudson belonged to the
Algonquins, as also New Jersey, a part of Virginia, and North Carolina,
Kentucky, Illinois and Wisconsin."

Algonquin is the generic name, but its many subdivisions and tribes
have their specific names such as those set down in ethnological tables
as the Abenaakis, Arapahoes, Cheyennes, Crees, Delawares, Foxes,
Illinois, Kickapoos, Mohicans, Massachusetts, Menominees, Montagnais,
Mohawks, Narragansetts, Nepinues, Ojibways, Ottawas, Powhattans, Sacs,
Shawnees, Wampanoags, Wappingers, etc.


IROQUOIS

The Iroquois were descendants of the Indians whom Jacques Cartier had
met on the banks of the St. Lawrence, in 1634. But at this time they
had drifted mysteriously to what is now New York territory, their
central seat, that of their confederacy or league of five nations,
being at Onondaga.

They were never numerous but they were very warlike. Although they
lost many in war, by disease and drunkenness, for they were filthy and
immoral in their habits, they recruited their strength by adopting
captives seized in their raids.

They lived in palisaded towns and were more intelligent than the
other races. Their houses, unsanitary and overrun with vermin, were
arched constructions, sometimes of 120 feet in length and were covered
with bark. In the centre of the lodge were the fires of the separate
families, who were divided into stalls. The smoke escaped as best it
could. They did not cultivate the land because they were so often on
the warpath, neither did they devote much energy in cultivating the
textile arts; hence they wore the skins of animals.

They had very vague notions of a Supreme Being, their chief object of
worship being Agreskoué, the God of War, who had to be propitiated
with gifts and even by human sacrifices. Theirs has been described by
General Clark as literally "devil worship." They had no priesthood
as such, but each brave had his _oki_ or _manitou_, adopted after a
protracted period of seclusion and fasting. They had their medicine
men, who seemed to the missionaries to use diabolical arts in their
incantations, spells and dances. Many of their sorcerers, however, were
childish charlatans. They were immoral, thieves, liars, gamblers; they
allowed their children to run wild, their women to grow up depraved
and corrupt from girlhood. They were cruel and cannibals. The orgies
of the dream feasts were unspeakably atrocious, especially after the
introduction of "fire water."

They were called by the French collectively "Iroquois," by the English
the "Five Nations," whereas they styled themselves the _Hodenosaunee_,
a People of the Long House, because of the shape of their lodges. They
were joined by the Tuscaroras about 1721 and from then on they were
called by the English the "Six Nations."

As to their name the Bureau of American Ethnology derives it from an
Algonquin word, "Iriakhoué," meaning "real adders." Charlevoix gives a
descriptive derivation from _hero_, or _hiro_, meaning "I have spoken,"
with which they terminated their discourses with the suffix _que_,
or some equivalent gutteral sound which expressed pain or pleasures,
according to the intonation. Thus the French called them "Iroquois."


The five nations were named as follows:

  (English)        (French)             (Iroquois)

  _The Five                            _Hodenosaunee_
    Nations_      _Iroquois_         (People of the Long House)


   Mohawks,        Agniers,             Ganeagono (People of the Flint),
   Oneidas,        Onneyutus,           Oneyotekiano (Granite People),
   Onondagas,      Onontagués,          Onundagono (Hill People),
   Cayuga,         Gogogouins,          Gwengwhehons (Muckland People),
   Senecas.        Tsonnontouans.       Mundawono (Great Hill People).

"The Six Nations, Indians in Canada," by J. B. Mackenzie, gives some
modern characteristics of the Iroquois, observed on the Grand River,
after a length of experience and intimate knowledge of the appearance
and manners and racial customs, which may be quoted to illustrate the
life of their ancestors of the period we are now treating. The reserve,
the writer notices, comprises the Township of Tuscarora (about twelve
miles square) with an insignificant strip of territory in the Township
of Onondaga--both of these lying within the County of Brant and a small
portion of the Township of Oneida, in the adjoining County of Haldimand.

The following present-day characteristics are noted: The Indian
maintains a better average as to height than his white brother, say
at about 5 ft. 8-1/2 in. He is straight and is rarely "bowlegged."
The Indian would appear to be built more for fleetness than for
strength; litheness and agility are with him, marked characteristics.
The dignity of chief among the Indians is attained upon the principle
of heredity succession. In case of the death of a chief, this did not
necessarily devolve upon the next of kin. The naming of his successor
with the privilege of determining whether or not he fulfills, in point
of character and capacity, the qualifications requisite to maintain
worthily the position, is confided to the women of the dead chief's
family, whose tribe has been deprived of one of its heads. They are
given a wide latitude in choosing; so long as they recognize through
their appointment the governing, basic theory of kinship to the
deceased ruler, their nomination will be unreservedly approved.

The chiefs are looked upon as the fathers of the tribe. In the earlier
days when the demon of war was about, wisdom and bravery were the chief
requisites.

Oratory is still of supreme importance with the modern Indian. In this
he is well equipped with a deep, powerful voice of rare volume and
resonance. He has great facility of gesture and marvelous control of
facial expression, which becomes the index of his emotions--a perfect
mirror of his imaginative soul. It is no wonder then that, we hear
of chiefs and orators of old haranguing for hours, for, even today,
the undivided, keen attention bestowed on an orator, the unflagging
interest evinced, the genuine and sympathetic appreciation his more
ambitious flights evoke, the liberal applause exhorted by periods, when
denunciation, scorn, or other strong mood that may possess the speaker
is expressed--periods at which he has been aroused to withering, or
flaming invective--all make us vividly realize the powerful oratory
of their predecessors. The contemplative and esthetic bent of the
Indian, living amidst nature's simplicities and deeply impressed by
them, overflowed in the similes and metaphors of his speech. There is
no doubt of his rightful claim to eloquence. The present-day Christian
Indian "believes vaguely in the existence of a Supreme Being, though
his idea of that Being's benignity and consideration relates solely
to an earthly oversight of him, a parental concern for his daily
wants. His conception of future happiness is wholly sensual--bound
up, in many cases, with the theories of an unrestrained indulgence of
animal appetite, and a whole-souled abandonment to riotous diversion.
That estimate of an hereafter, which has gained his unreserved, his
heartfelt approbation--one, in the more complete idealizing of which
these coarser fancies constitute familiar adjuvants--adopts for
cardinal, for constant factor, his thoroughgoing addiction, in some
renovated state of being, to pastimes found congenial and appeasing in
life--their undisturbed enthroning, as it were. Joyously, anticipation
clings to a haunt delectable--happily and charmingly contrived to
embosom spacious parks immure seductive coverts; refreshed soothingly
his spirits by dreams of illimitable, virgin preserves, which should be
stocked with unnumbered game, and where--equipped to perfection for the
chase--he should plunge with satiety into its vehement pursuit."

"It has been said that the Indian, agog for some ample scheme of
ethics, is much more prone to follow the evil than the moral practices
of the whites.... There can be no doubt, I fancy, that were the
Indian to be thrown continuously with a corrupt community amongst the
whites--should he consort freely with a class with whom a lower order
of morality obtains--his acquisition of higher knowledge, instead of
giving him better and finer tastes, must inevitably make him more
skilled in planning works of iniquity."

The writer draws attention to the sardonic delight the humorous Indian
takes in perpetrating some dire practical joke on his victim. The same
trait was shown in this early period, when the brave would calmly smoke
his pipe and grimly watch the Christian missionary's finger forcibly
placed in it, gradually frizzle away.

The modern Iroquois is a supremely indolent creature--fasting stoically
when food does not come easily, but ever ready for unbounded feasting.

The effect of spirituous liquors on him is the same as of old, and
justifies the attempts of the Montreal clergy to suppress its traffic
to the natives. "Intoxicants," says the writer quoted, "when freely
used by the Indian, cloud, often wholly dethrone his reason, annul his
self-control; madly slaying all the gentler, enkindle and set ablaze
all the baser, emotions of his nature, impelling him to acts vile,
inhuman, bestial; with direful transforming power, make the man a
fiend, leave him, in short, the mere sport of demoniac passion. It may
be thought that this is an overdrawn sketch, and that, even if it were
true--which I aver it to be--full exposure of its fearsome aspect, its
sombre outlines, might well have been withheld."


FOOTNOTES:

[44] Dollier de Casson says that Montreal was all handed over on
October 15, 1641. Vimont, who was an eye witness, gives the date as May
17, 1642. See "Relations for 1642." We combine both accounts.

[45] The scene was the angular tongue of low-lying land, known by
Dollier de Casson who came in 1666, on September 7, as "the Common,"
its memory being preserved by Common Street, watered on the south by
the lapping waters of the great St. Lawrence and on the east by the
narrow river St. Peter, long since dried up, which, meandering from the
northwest, skirted the meadow on the north and emptied itself into the
main stream. At this point and up this harbour the flotilla came to
anchor. On the third side of this triangle was a marshy land which was
dried up by Dollier de Casson and became the "domaine des Seigneurs."

[46] Later this chapel gave place to another 25 feet long by 26 broad,
the former room now becoming a "parloir." The new meeting place in the
fort is sometimes spoken of as the chapel or the church. The abbé,
Louis Bertrand de la Tour, says there was a _church_ in 1645. We may
thus put it earlier.--"Annales des Hospitalières par la Soeur Morin."

[47] "The house of the fort," says Sister Morin in her Annals, "existed
till 1682 or 1683, when they finished demolishing it, although it was
only of wood, where is at present the house of M. de Callières, our
governor today." On July 2nd, 1688, de Callières obtained a concession
of the land occupied by the fort. The land book (_livre terrier_) of
the Seminary has the description: "_Quinze perches et demie de front
sur le fleuve, à continuer à pareille larguer jusqu'au bord de la
petite rivière; en superficie 1882 1/2 touses, avec droit de passage,
sur la pointe en avant, appartenant aux Seigneurs._" This point was the
original cemetery till 1654. From Callières' building the Place Royale
began to be spoken of as the Pointe à Callières. Jacques Viger, one
of the fathers of historical researches in Montreal, said that in his
early days he had seen the ruins of de Callières' house.

[48] The parish register has frequent records of their names as
sponsors for the baptized Indian children. They were proud of the
honour. Among the names frequently occurring in the following few
years are Madame d'Ailleboust, Jeanne Mance, Philipine de Boulogne,
Charlotte Barré, Catherine Lezeau and Madame de la Peltrie. Next year,
1644, there is only one baptism recorded; the Iroquois were on the
warpath and had driven the Hurons away. The godmother on this occasion
was Madame de la Peltrie. The date, January 21, 1644, in the parish
register fixing this, shows that she had spent the winter of 1643-4
in Montreal. She left, when the river opened in the spring, to return
to the Ursulines of Quebec, whose establishment she had founded and
with whom she resided till her death. Her stay in Montreal had been
prolonged by her interest in the new foundation, and by her desire to
help it in its early struggles. Her departure was deeply regretted by
the colony, and by none more than by Jeanne Mance, for there were all
too few ladies to help in the devoted work. M. de Puiseaux left at
the same time. Madame de la Peltrie's character has been frequently
discussed. Kingsford in his "History of Canada" devotes two pages to
her. As Montreal only had her presence for less than two years we have
given this note as the impression left of her by all the Montreal
chroniclers. Kingsford says, Vol. I, p. 165: "Much romance has been
thrown over a somewhat commonplace character. Her portraits remain.
A more coquettish, heartless form of beauty is seldom to be found,
either under the adornment of fashion or the hood and veil of the
devotee." Madame de la Peltrie never became a nun. It is to be feared
that Kingsford theorized on matters of Catholic custom through lack of
adequate knowledge, or appreciation.

[49] In the parish church of Notre Dame there is still preserved the
first register of the births, marriages and deaths. It is a manuscript
volume in quarto composed of five note-books. The earliest entries
are in Latin and are ratified by either Père Poncet or Père Duperon,
who served the mission. The first registers were probably written on
fly sheets in 1646 and afterwards copied, for until June 24th the
handwriting appears to be that of a copyist. There are certain blanks
as if the names had been forgotten. The baptismal book appears to start
with an error. The first baptism, that of an Indian child, is put
down for April 28, 1642 (this is probably the date of Father Poncet's
appointment), whereas Père Vimont in his "Relations" for 1642, says it
was on July 1st. The second baptism took place on October 9th. Several
other baptisms are marked down for the month of March, 1643, but the
copyist, better informed, has written "August" between the lines. In
those days handwriting and spelling were not "de rigueur."

[50] This spot, named Pointe à Callières, "ad confluxium magni et
parvi fluminis," was at the junction of the River St. Peter and the
St. Lawrence opposite Ile Normandin, and took its name from the house
of the governor, then Chevalier Hector de Callières, built there in
1668. It is now occupied by the custom house (1914). The plans of the
Château Callières are preserved in the plans of Montreal, 1723, by M.
de Catalogne, and in those of 1761 by M. P. Labrosse. This remained a
cemetery till 1654, when, owing to the inundations, the burials were
transferred to a plot occupied in part today by that Place d'Armes,
which, being in the neighbourhood of the hospital, was called in the
act of burial of 1654 the "new hospital cemetery." The bodies were
not removed, out of respect, till 1793, when the land had been ceded
by the seigneurs to Louis Guy, notary, by an act passed before Joseph
Papineau, November 22, 1749. The Hôtel-Dieu ground was used as the
cemetery for twenty-five years.

[51] Dollier de Casson tells this story, which he had from
eye-witnesses; de Maisonneuve was a very generous and unselfish man.

[52] The more so, as the publication of the "véritables motifs,"
issued by the Associates of the Company of Montreal in defense
of the settlement in clearly stating its aims and justifying the
singlemindedness of its promoters, had gained it many friends, among
whom were many in high places.

[53] The Jesuits had charge of the mission from April 28, 1643, and
continued it up to August 12, 1657. The Sulpicians then took it over,
their first act recorded in the first registers of births, marriages
and sepultures being on August 28, 1657.

[54] One value of the "Motifs" for modern day readers is that it gives
the foundation of Montreal the note of inspiration which is a mark not
claimed by many other cities.

Louis XIII, who died on May 14, 1643, was succeeded by his young
son, Louis XIV, then a child of five years of age. The policy of his
father in regard to Montreal was continued by him, through the Queen
Regent under the advice of the Duke of Orléans, uncle of the king,
and of Prince Henri de Condé, former viceroy of Canada, who gave the
"Company of Montreal" by new letters patent, dated February 13, 1644,
in the name of the king, the most powerful and honourable recognition,
ratifying all previous powers given. In particular, it gave it power
to make and receive pious legacies and foundations for the savages and
for other Christian movements. The position of the governor of Montreal
is again made clear, "and to allow the inhabitants of Montreal to live
in peace, police and concord, we permit the Associates to commission a
captain or local governor whom they shall desire to name themselves for
us."--(Edits et Ordonnances, I, 24-25.)

The king ordered M. de Montmagny to promulgate these letters. To make
M. de Maisonneuve's position clearer, the Associates, in accord with
the above royal permit, confirmed him anew by a commission, dated March
26, 1644, as local governor (_gouverneur particulier de ce pays_).

This year de Maisonneuve's initiative had brought about that the town
was erected into a municipal corporation and that the civil interests
should be watched by a syndic or tribune of the people. This officer
was elected to represent the colonists, to look after the general good
of the island, to see after the taxes for the upkeep of the garrison
and to bring to justice those who damaged others' property. It was,
however, an honorary position and was subject to election, no one being
allowed to continue for more than three successive years. The election
was usually held in the "hangar" or the dépôt of "the Company of
Montreal," whither the inhabitants for the most part usually resorted
for all necessary clothing, utensils, and even provisions. Later on,
the elections took place in the hall of the seminary or that of the
fort.

This first step of popular representation was then an advanced
movement. Montreal was thus ahead of Quebec, which did not have a
syndic till 1663. In 1672, as we shall see, even this slight concession
to self government was deplored, and Frontenac, who started with broad
views of interesting the people in their affairs, by continuing them in
their separate classes, was told from France by the Minister Colbert to
desist and even gradually to suppress the syndic's office.

When d'Ailleboust arrived in August, 1643, he had brought an
important communication for Jeanne Mance from her friend the "unknown
benefactress," whom we know as Madame de Bullion. This good lady was
resolved to establish a hospital. She had set aside an annual income
of 2,000 _livres_ for this purpose and now in addition sent 12,000
_livres_ to build and furnish it, besides 200 _livres_ to be employed
according to the discretion of Jeanne Mance.

But sickness had been singularly absent up to this. A few rooms
reserved in the mission house had so far sufficed for hospital
purposes. Indeed, Jeanne Mance had recommended that the money should
be devoted to the upkeep of the Jesuit missions among the Hurons, a
proposition which did not please Madame de Bullion, who insisted in
carrying on her pious design.

Thus on January 14th of this year (1664) she had placed a fund, 42,000
_livres_, to endow the hospital, 6,000 of which were to be employed
at once on building operations. So, confident that the work was now
completed, she sent a convoy of furniture and a present of 2,000
_livres_ for Jeanne Mance for current expenses. This persistency forced
de Maisonneuve to postpone other activities and he now diverted the
work of his carpenters to the new foundation. In choosing the site for
it, mindful of the danger of floods, he chose an elevated spot a short
distance outside the fort across the streamlet St. Pierre,[55] and built
the first Hôtel-Dieu of Montreal, a building 60 feet long by 24 broad,
containing a room for Jeanne Mance, one for the attendants and two for
the sick. A little stone chapel was annexed, about nine to ten feet
square, which was furnished with requirements for the altar next year
by the Company. On October 8th, the hospital, dedicated according to
the pious wish of its founder "au nom et en honneur de St. Joseph," was
ready to receive the sick. It was also furnished by the Associates with
all the appliances necessary.[56] Jeanne Mance must have felt at last
happy on entering on her life-long vocation.

The hospital had its modest farm of four arpents, with its two bulls,
three cows and twenty sheep. M. de Maisonneuve's carpenters surrounded
it with a strong palisade as a protection, should the Iroquois venture
to attack it by night.

Hardly had the hospital been completed than the anxiety of Jeanne Mance
as to its utility was dispersed, for it was immediately needed for the
sick and wounded who filled it on account of the daily attacks of the
Iroquois. Indeed they were soon obliged to add another hall, the two
rooms mentioned not being sufficient.

We now resume the military history of Montreal.

After the loss of five of his men in June, 1643, de Maisonneuve issued
orders to safeguard his handful of men and women. When the men went
out of the fort to their work, the sound of the bell gathered them so
that they should go forth together, armed, and at dinner time it again
recalled them in the same fashion. This precaution was necessary to
guard them against the surprises of the Iroquois who sometimes remained
for days together hidden in the adjoining woods or brush, watching,
cat-like, on the ground or in the trees for an opportunity to sally
forth and cut off any straggler. Then they would retreat with extreme
agility back to their accustomed lairs.

[Illustration: CROUCHING IROQUOIS

(By Philippe Hébert)]

The more impatient of his men were all for attacking the enemy in the
woods, but the governor restrained them, urging the extreme imprudence
of so slight a force attempting to cope with an unknown number, in a
mode of warfare in which the enemy were so experienced. Nor could he
run the risk of losing one of his brave defenders.

A valuable assistance was provided by the watch dogs of the fort
brought from France. We are responsible to Dollier de Casson, and
Father Lalemant in the "Relations" of 1647, for the story of a bitch
named Pilot who every morning made the tour of the fort's environs,
accompanied by her pups, to discover the hiding places of the Iroquois.
Should they scent the Iroquois they would turn quickly on their course,
and barking and yelping furiously in the direction of the enemy, would
convey the news to the fort. Thus many a lurking snare was avoided by
the settlers.

The mother was indefatigable in her duty. If one of the pups became
lazy or stubborn she would bite it to make it go on. Should, however,
one of them turn back and escape, in the midst of the round, a beating
assuredly awaited it when Pilot returned into camp.[57]

On an occasion when the barking and yelping were more insistent than
usual, proclaiming the nearness of the foe, the impetuous ones of the
camp would again approach the governor, asking if they were never to
oust the Iroquois by an attack. The governor's policy of delay was
still maintained. "My brave boys," he said, "it is most unwise."

But now rendered impatient, murmurs arose in camp and doubt was cast
upon the governor's courage. This coming to his ears, and fearing,
lest his prudence, being taken for pusillanimity should thus lower his
prestige and power of command, he determined for once to change his
tactics.

The chance offered shortly, for on May 30th of this year (1644), the
persistent barking of the dogs brought the malcontents to him with
their querulous cry again: "Monsieur, shall we never go against the
foe?" To their surprise the calm, brusque reply of the soldier met
them: "Yes, you shall meet the foe; prepare at once for attack; but let
each one be as brave as his word. I myself will lead you!"

There was hurry in the camp, each one of the men sought his gun, his
ammunition, and his _racquettes_, or Indian snowshoes, for the snow
was deep. But there was an insufficiency of the latter. At last the
scanty force of forty men was mustered. The governor put the fort into
the hands of M. d'Ailleboust, and giving him directions to follow out
should he himself never return from the fray, he led his men towards
the foe.

When the Iroquois had noticed this, dividing their force of two hundred
into several bands, they put themselves in ambuscades and awaited the
approach of the men from the fort. As these entered into the woods,
they were met with shots from the Iroquois' muskets on all sides.

Seeing his men thus attacked by so large a force, M. de Maisonneuve
ordered them to get behind the trees, as the Iroquois were, and then
ensued a brisk exchange of shots on either side, so long and furious
that their ammunition giving out and several of his men being already
killed or wounded, de Maisonneuve ordered a retreat. This was no easy
matter, for they were badly equipped with the snowshoes, and those who
had none sank deep into the snow and were hindered in their retreat
while the Iroquois were all well shod and skillful in their use, so
that, as Dollier de Casson relates:

"Qu'à peine étions-nous de l'infanterie, au rapport de cavalerie."

At this period of unrest and danger the hospital was being built
outside the tort, a quadrilateral building, 320 feet in length and an
enclosure flanked by four stone bastions which were connected by a
wooden curtain twelve feet high. In carrying the wood for construction
a beaten path had been made to it, so that the snow was hard and firm,
and progress was easy here without the need of snowshoes. Thither,
under Maisonneuve's directions, the Frenchmen hurried as best they
could, turning to face the enemy, from time to time, to return their
shots. When they reached the footpath, they ran headlong to the fort at
the top of their speed, terrified by the number of Iroquois pursuing
them, and leaving their commander to fall behind, alone and unprotected.

Meanwhile those left behind in the fort, hearing the uproar, and
seeing their approach, and mistaking them for the enemy, one of them
imprudently fired the cannon which stood already directed towards that
road to guard it during the building operations. Providentially the
fuse failed.[58]

The abandoned leader was now face to face with the Iroquois with a
pistol in either hand, fearful each moment of being seized by them.
Thus he kept them at bay. Meanwhile the Iroquois, recognizing him as
the governor, wished to capture him alive to make a show of him to
their tribes and to reserve him for greater cruelties, and so they
delayed a little till their captain came up, to leave to him the honour
of the capture. The chief now leaped forward towards de Maisonneuve
and was almost on his shoulders, when the governor fired one of his
pistols. The pistol did not act and the savage leaped upon him in fury
and seized him by the neck, but raising his other pistol above his
shoulders the governor laid the chief stiff and dead upon the ground,
to the indignation of the surrounding Iroquois watching this single
combat. They hurried at once to secure the dead body of the chief. In
their anxiety lest there should be any force returning from the fort to
seize their chieftain's body, and bear it away as a trophy of victory
against the Iroquois, their attention was diverted from the governor
who, on the fall of his opponent, had fled and been allowed to escape
to the fort.

[Illustration: MAISONNEUVE'S EXPLOIT

(A bas relief from the Maisonneuve Monument by Philippe Hébert)]

This act of courage silenced all suspicion of personal cowardice on the
part of the governor. His former policy was now commended, and the men
protested they would never expose themselves rashly, again.

The parish records of Ville Marie this year reveal the absence of
Indian baptisms. This is due to the fear of the Hurons in approaching
the beleaguered fort. In addition the approaches were cut off. For
in the spring of this year the Iroquois were divided into ten bands,
scattered here and there on the St. Lawrence, breathing fury against
the French, the Hurons and the Algonquins. The Island of Montreal
itself had been visited by one of these bands at the Rivière des
Prairies, and by another, with whom the recent fight described, took
place.

Thus the whole country was in alarm, when, in the summer of 1644, a
reinforcement from France arrived, sent by the queen regent and the
Company of One Hundred Associates, of sixty men to be divided among the
various posts. With them came another force for Montreal sent at the
expense of the Company of Montreal. At this time Fort Richelieu was in
great danger and the new addition was much valued.

The new expedition was under the command of the Sieur Labarre, who
then came on to settle at Montreal in the summer with a number of new
colonists. The early historians speak very slightingly of this man.
He appears to have had the reputation of being very religious. At
Rochelle he carried a large string of rosary beads in his girdle, and
he also had a crucifix which he had almost incessantly before his eyes,
so as to be considered an apostolic man. Hence his appointment. But
this great "hypocrite" was found out in the intimate village life of
Montreal and he was asked very shortly to retire to France as we shall
see.

This year marks the beginning of agriculture in Montreal. Wheat had
been sown principally through the initiative of Louis d'Ailleboust, who
had come in the previous year.

But the difficulty of tilling and sowing the ground, when the workers
had to carry their arms with them amid the danger of such surprises as
we have described, rendered agriculture precarious, and in consequence
the grain produced this year was not sufficient to support even the
small colony. Its provisions had still to be sent from France.

The year 1645 started with an important change in the attitude of
the Company of New France. Public opinion in the motherland had been
drawn to Canadian affairs. The Montreal venture and the publication
of the "Véritables Motifs" had thrown discredit on the Company as a
colonizing force. This body at first no doubt blustered somewhat, but
finally, from fear of being looked upon as mere private speculators,
it was ready to listen to reason. There had been representation from
Quebec from the colonists there that the monopoly of the fur trade by
the Company menaced commerce and prevented Frenchmen coming to Canada.
A modification or suppression of this monopoly as the only means of
increasing and firmly "establishing the colony" was demanded.

Accordingly, after having considered these matters at its annual
meeting in December, we find the Company at a subsequent one, on
January 7th, making, at the demand of the queen regent and the
solicitation of the Jesuits, a treaty with the colonists of New France,
by which they handed over to them the trade in peltry excluding that
of Acadia, Miscou and Cape Breton. This treaty was concluded between
the Company and the representatives of the colonists, MM. de Repentigny
and Godefroi, on January 14, 1644, and ratified by the king on July 13,
1645.--(Edits et Ordonnances.)

The history, therefore, of free trade for Montreal starts from this
period, for we have seen how it had been crippled in its original
charter. Still the troublous times it had been undergoing had not
allowed them at Montreal to feel their restrictions, just as the
times still ahead were not suitable for availing themselves of their
new privileges, for war paralyzed commerce. If truth be told, the
deputation from Canada had obtained a beautiful scheme on paper; the
Company came out the winner.

The document is worthy of consideration.

After conceding to the "habitans du dit pays," present and to come, the
right and license of the trade in skins and peltry in New France ...
it orders that the said "habitans" shall for the future keep up the
colony of New France, and shall discharge for the Company the ordinary
expenses hitherto paid by it for the maintenance and appointments of
ecclesiastics, governor, lieutenants, captains, soldiers and garrisons
in the forts and habitations, and that in consideration of the expenses
already incurred by the Company.

The Company, however, was to retain the name, titles, authority, rights
and powers accorded in its original edict of establishment and to
remain in full ownership, possession, judiciary, seigneurial tenure of
all the country and extent of the lands of New France.

Thus it placed all responsibility on the inhabitants themselves.
Montreal would not suffer very much, because, being a private
corporation, it had already offered to maintain itself at its own cost.

The year 1645 opened again with Iroquois attacks, "but," says Dollier
de Casson, "God has been favourable to us."

The men of the fort even killed some of their assailants, and owing to
the wise soldiership of the governor, not one of his own were killed,
all this year.

[Illustration: A. The fort built in 1645. E. First cemetery in

[Illustration: RESIDENCE OF M. DE CHOMEDEY DE MAISONNEUVE]

Meanwhile, the Indian allies still kept away. But on September 7th the
fort welcomed a body of sixty of them who came under the escort of a
band of the soldiers sent out from France the previous year. These
latter had been ordered on arriving to winter with the Hurons and
protect them from the Iroquois, and they were now on their way back to
the governor of Quebec with a load of skins to the value of thirty to
forty thousand _livres_.

It will be remembered that the disposition of the peltry was now in
the hands of the colonists themselves on condition that they should
maintain the upkeep of the departments of church and state. On arriving
in Quebec there was a disagreement as to the disposal of the profits
of the sale. Finally the colonists devoted part of their proceeds to
the construction of the Jesuit house there.

This year also de Montmagny and the inhabitants applied the product of
1,250 beaver skins to their new church being constructed at Quebec and
dedicated to Our Lady of Peace in view of the conclusion of peace, now
heartily desired.

The possibilities of trade must have appealed to the Montrealers from
the arrival of the above party, the more so as their restrictions had
been removed.

This month, the negotiations for peace were concluded at a
representative gathering of Iroquois and the French allies with the
French party under de Montmagny and thus the first Iroquois war was
over.

Peace now gave M. de Maisonneuve an opportunity to go to France to
arrange the affairs of his father; so putting his own in order, he left
the government of Ville Marie in the good hands of his lieutenant,
Louis d'Ailleboust. He departed, to the great grief of all the fort
gathered at the harbour mouth, but with the promise of a speedy return.
M. de Maisonneuve left Quebec on October 20th, on one of the Company's
ships bearing their season's fur skins to France. He "deported," as we
would say, with him the "undesirable" Sieur de Labarre, whose hypocrisy
had been unmasked in Montreal, "when it became known," as Dollier de
Casson quaintly relates, "he was frequently taking promenades in the
wood with an Indian woman whom he had defiled (qu'il engrossa). There
was no more of the saint about this man than his chapelet and his
deceitful look, for under the guise of virtue he hid a very wicked
life which has made him since finish his days behind a 'bar' which was
heavier than his name of Barre."

This year the Jesuit missioners in charge of Ville Marie were Fathers
Buteaux and Isaac Jogues. Both of these men were zealous pioneers. Each
bore on his body the marks of Iroquois' ill treatment. Yet they did not
ask to be recalled to France and rest on their laurels. Father Jogues
had, however, been recalled after his mutilation, but his missionary
zeal prompted him to return. He profited by the peace, which brought
many of the Iroquois out of curiosity to the fort, to make friends with
them as he wished to work among their tribes shortly.

After Maisonneuve had concluded the arrangement of his father's affairs
he was free for many conferences with members of the Company of
Montreal. Ever since they had written to the pope in 1643 it was their
great desire, and that of Maisonneuve especially, it being thought that
peace was concluded, to establish a bishopric in Canada. As they had
agreed to support the expense of maintaining such a post, preferably
at Montreal, they arranged that one of their number, a M. Legauffre,
a secular priest who had a private fortune of his own, should be
nominated to fill the episcopal see.

His unexpected death now came, but he left a legacy of 30,000 _livres_
towards the founding of a see.

In the meeting of the bishops at the general assembly of the clergy
on May 25, 1646, Mgr. Godeau, bishop of Grasse, promoted the movement
for the establishment of the see, and in July, at the meeting of July
11th, Cardinal Mazarin promised to employ his services with his majesty
towards that end, while he also promised 1,200 _écus_. But as at Quebec
and Three Rivers there was no desire for a bishop, especially in view
of the uncertain nature of the peace, the negotiations were eventually
discontinued, as it became evident that the state of the country
was too unsettled. Still the progressive Montrealers had by their
enterprise and initiative suggested the establishment of a see, which
was erected later on the coming of Laval.

A notable personage now enters into the story of Montreal, Charles le
Moyne. He was then a young man of twenty years of age, but he had been
already in the colony since 1641 and had traveled in the service of the
Jesuits on their Huron missions. Thus he had acquired the knowledge of
their language and that of the Iroquois, and it was with the purpose
of being useful to the fort at Montreal, as an interpreter with the
Iroquois, that he had been sent by de Montmagny to supply a need which
the fort had experienced in dealing with the Indians.

[Illustration: CHARLES LE MOYNE

(By Philippe Hébert)]

M. de Maisonneuve returned at Quebec on September 20th, but hardly
had he arrived there than he received a letter from M. Dauversière
that his brother-in-law had been assassinated and that his mother was
contemplating a second marriage; the latter, seeming to be looked upon
as a ruinous event for the family, he had to cross back immediately to
France to stay its execution. He sailed for that country on October
31st, but while waiting for the boat to go he transacted some business
in Quebec and returned to M. Puiseaux his original donation to the
Company of Montreal, of the fiefs of St. Michel and St. Foy and the
other gifts which he had given in his early enthusiasm, but which he
afterwards reclaimed.

In recompense the Company of Montreal was reimbursed for the
improvements made on the land at St. Michel. This action of M. Puiseaux
is attributed to his failing faculties. However, by his will made at
Rochelle next year, June 21st, he gave the land of Ste. Foy for the
maintenance of the future bishop.

During the calm, which was soon to be perturbed, Charles d'Ailleboust
completed his fortifications with four regular bastions, so well
constructed that the fort exterior was the pride of Canada. The fault
was the delay in not having chosen another site, for even now the
floods and the ice-pushes from the St. Lawrence threatened many times
to upheave the fortifications, and by 1672 the fort was in ruins. Yet
for the present they were of avail and inspired fear in the Iroquois
and pride in the colonists. Agriculture was largely advanced by
d'Ailleboust by cultivating lands for himself and having the same done
for the settlement.

But war was again looming ahead. Signs were not wanting by the gradual
dispersal of the Indian allies from the fort during the late autumn. On
November 17th, three Hurons who were at Ville Marie, having gone to the
hunt, returned, with the loss of one of their companions. A few days
after, having gone in search of him, they were captured by a band of
Iroquois. On November 30, 1646, two Frenchmen were taken at a distance
from the camp. Thus it became evident that the peace had never been
thoroughly intended, for news came in on all sides of disasters from
the Iroquois. The year 1647 passed in troublous vexations. To the great
joy of the settlement M. de Maisonneuve returned in the spring of 1648
and found that life was indeed a warfare.

The wars of the Iroquois were fiercer than ever. Fear filled the
hearts of all the Montrealers. The fort was the centre of surprises.
Yet this year the first windmill was constructed by de Maisonneuve, at
what is still known as Windmill Point. It was built with loopholes for
musketry, so that the mill was intended not only to grind the wheat but
to be an advanced redoubt and a challenge to the Iroquois to show them
that the French were not ready to abandon their field of glory. On
October 21st Charles d'Ailleboust went to France whence he would return
as the governor general.

A word should now be said of the government of the country. By a decree
of the king in 1647 it had been arranged that the government of the
country should be left in the matter of police, commerce and war in the
hands of three, viz., the governor general, the superior of the Jesuits
and the governor of Montreal.

The governor of Quebec was given a salary of 25,000 _livres_, with the
privilege of having sent to him each year, without expense, seventy
tons of freight by the vessels of the fleet on the condition that he
should provide the fort with arms and ammunitions. He was to have,
besides, his own private lieutenant, another at Three Rivers, and
finally sixty-six garrison men who should be maintained at the expense
of the stores. It was further settled that the governor general should
journey into the country as he should judge fit.

As to the local governor of Montreal his salary should be 10,000
_livres_, with thirty tons of freight, and he was to support a garrison
of thirty men. Finally 5,000 _livres_ were granted annually to the
superior of the Jesuits for their missions.

These privileges of the royal decision did not give pleasure to many
in the colony. M. de Maisonneuve seems to have opposed them in France.
It was alleged that M. de Montmagny, in the frequent absence from
Quebec, of the superior of the Jesuits on missions, and that of the
governor of Montreal, was practically sole ruler; that he was drawing
too large a salary and was not fulfilling the conditions imposed upon
him in safeguarding the other outposts of the colony. Thus there was
dissatisfaction among the colonists, and M. Charles d'Ailleboust with
M. des Chastelets went to France to procure amendments.

M. de Montmagny was about to be recalled. His rule was considered
inefficient. A mémoire by M. de la Chesnaye says that there was a
secret cabal intriguing against the governor, composed of a few of the
chief families, who went to France to enrich themselves, and got one of
their own named as governor general. This alludes to de Maisonneuve,
des Chastelets and d'Ailleboust. The former is known to have refused a
nomination to the post and des Chastelets and d'Ailleboust, among other
things, asked for a reduction of the salary of the governor general
from 25,000 _livres_ to 10,000.

On the 5th of March, 1648, these amendments passed. In addition the
governing council of Canada was now to be composed of the governor
general, the superior of the Jesuits, and MM. de Chavigny, Godefroy of
Quebec, and Giffard, to which body the local governors of Three Rivers
and Montreal should be added when they should happen to be in Quebec.

[Illustration:

to Pierre Gadoys. The deed itself is completely written in the
handwriting of the governor himself. Under the signature of Paul de
Chomedey is the acceptance of the concession by Pierre Gadoys before
the notary, Jean de St. Pierre. This is at once the first deed of
concession and the first notarial act registered in Montreal, January
4, 1648.]

Finally the king ordered that it would be necessary for two at least
of the councillors to deliberate with the governor. The salary of the
governor general was reduced to 10,000 _livres_, the sixty tons of
freight to twelve, and his garrison to twelve men, and it was ruled
that the local governors of Montreal and Three Rivers should each
receive 3,000 _livres_, six tons of freight and six soldiers.

The 19,000 _livres_ over should be partially employed in raising a
"camp volant," or flying squadron drawn from men of existing garrisons
if there should be sufficient so disposable, or if not, it should be
raised as soon as possible. In the summer this flying squadron should
guard all the passages by land and water under the command of some
capable officer to be appointed by the governor, and in the winter it
should be distributed in the garrisons to sally forth thence to beat
the bush and to rove around.

The rest of the 19,000 _livres_ should be employed in purchasing arms
and ammunition. Besides this flying squadron the king allowed a company
formed by the settlers at their own expense to act as the necessary
escort to the Hurons or the missionaries. For the support of this,
trading was allowed on these journeys on the condition of bringing the
skins to the government stores at Quebec and sold at the price fixed by
the Quebec council.

These changes were not received with favour by the old party and
d'Ailleboust was made to realize this on his way back. However, he
came to Quebec as governor general on August 20th and was received
with "generous magnanimity" by Montmagny, who left on September 23d.
Madame d'Ailleboust and her sister, Phillipine de Boulogne, joined the
governor at Quebec. There was grief at Montreal in losing them, but
this was tempered by its pride in furnishing the governor general from
its midst.

A few words are needed in further explanation of the "camp volant"
above alluded to.

"In 1642," according to Benjamin Suite, Canadian Antiquarian and
Numismatic Journal, 1879, "there were no less than seventy soldiers at
Three Rivers whose duty it was, not only to defend that place against
the Iroquois, but to patrol Lake St. Peter also. The same year only
fifteen soldiers were quartered at Quebec--a much less exposed position
than Three Rivers. In the year 1644 some troops were sent to Canada by
Anne d'Autriche. Twenty-three of these soldiers accompanied the Hurons,
the missionaries and a few Frenchmen, who went to the Georgian Bay that
summer. M. Ferland says that the garrison of Montreal numbered thirty
men in 1647; but he evidently means the thirty men placed under the
orders of Jean Bourdon for reconnaissance purposes on Lake St. Peter."
These were "soldiers" from 1642; from 1649 there were volunteers, and
from 1651, if not before, a sedentary militia was established.

About 1647 Montmagny had considered a project for forming an active
militia to be on the lookout against the Iroquois, but his resources
were too slender. In the spring of 1649 the "camp volant" was organized
under the command of Charles J. d'Ailleboust de Musseaux, nephew of the
new governor general, M. d'Ailleboust. It numbered forty men and its
duty consisted in patrolling on the St. Lawrence between Montreal and
Three Rivers.

After the slaughter of Sieur Duplessis Kerbodot, nephew of M. Lauson,
now governing and the successor of de Musseaux, on August 19th,
together with fifteen Frenchmen, the "camp volant" became disorganized
for the winter, but it was apparently reformed in the summer of 1653.
After that it seems to have been neglected during the government
of D'Argenson and D'Avaugour. In fact a body of regular troops was
required to check the Iroquois, and not mere militia, whose men could
not attend to their farm and other business and at the same time keep
beating the country nearly all the year round. Hence the request for
troops, of Father Lejeune in 1660, and Pierre Boucher in 1661. In 1663
a body of militia was organized at Montreal.

The next spring, 1640, the "camp volant" of forty men was sent to
Montreal under the command of the nephew of the new governor, Charles
d'Ailleboust des Musseaux, to help to repulse the Iroquois. About the
same time the new governor went to pay his first official visit to
Ville Marie.

He communicated the king's order as above, and among other instructions
he communicated directions from the Company of Montreal. One, touching
the administration of the Hôtel-Dieu, regulated that the surgeon of
this house should attend the sick of the island gratuitously, both
French and Indians, and that the administration accounts of the
hospital should be rendered annually to the governor of Montreal, the
ecclesiastical superior and to the syndics of the inhabitants, who
should sign an act to be sent to Paris.

During this stay the governor, on May 3rd, put the Jesuits[59] formally
in possession of the Seigneurie de Madeleine on the south side of the
St. Lawrence, comprising land two leagues in length by four in depth,
stretching from St. Helen's island towards the Sault St. Louis. This
had been granted by François de Lauson on April 1, 1647.

Sad news had been brought to Jeanne Mance by the governor that many
of the Associates were losing their interest in Montreal and were
diverting their charities to the missions in the Levant. Anxious to get
further news she went to Quebec in the summer and there she found that
Père Rapin, the Recollect, her intermediary with Madame de Bullion, was
dead; that the Company of Montreal was almost dissolved; that M. de la
Dauversière was dangerously ill; that his affairs had become entangled,
and he was now a bankrupt. As he had money in trust for Madame de
Bullion, this was a blow for the colony.

The outlook for Montreal was now financially gloomy. Ville Marie was
also surrounded by war. Jeanne Mance therefore set sail from Quebec on
September 8th to interest her friends in the struggling settlement.
In this she was very successful. Madame de Bullion received her with
kindness and gave her a sum of money to engage workmen to till lands
to support the hospital. The Associates renewed their interest, and in
order to guarantee the continuance of their _Seigneurie_ a new act was
drawn up to supplement that of March 25, 1644, in which M. de Fancamp
and M. de la Dauversière had sworn that they were occupiers of Montreal
in the name of a company, so that these nine remaining members were now
publicly named and signed their names, making at the same time a mutual
donation, reciprocal and irrevocable, by which they handed over to the
last surviving of them the forts, habitations and outhouses, etc.,
belonging to the said Company. This was signed before the Notaries
Pourcelle and Chaussiere on March 21, 1650.[60]

The Company gave the hospital also 200 arpents of land. Jeanne Mance
saw many of the associates privately and stimulated their interest, as
well as that, of others. In the month of September, 1650, she arrived
at Quebec with some labourers and some virtuous marriageable girls,
leaving it on September 25th for Montreal and arriving there three days
before the feast of All Saints (November 1st).[61]

The year 1650 may be chronicled as that of the first general movement
towards agriculture. The constant fear of Iroquois' attacks had kept
the settlers pent up within the walls of the fort, although there
had been since 1643 individual attempts by Charles d'Ailleboust and
others outside.[62] The activity started by Jeanne Mance in putting
into cultivation the 200 arpents lately conceded by the Associates of
the Company of Montreal to the Hôtel-Dieu encouraged others to take to
the land and to build their dwellings on the concessions which they
now demanded from M. Maisonneuve, since it was now thought there was a
likelihood of peace.

These early grants were only of thirty arpents and to ensure as great
protection as possible against Iroquois attacks, they were clustered
around the fort and the brewery. In granting these lands, however, the
seigneurs stipulated that they could be exchanged later for others at a
remote distance, for the location at present used was reserved for the
future city, for the building of the market place, the port and other
public purposes.

What may be called the history of mutual building societies now starts,
for as the number of workmen were limited, the inhabitants, led by the
motives of fraternal charity and public spirit, formed associations to
help one another in the clearing of their lots and in the construction
of their homes. Thus a contract dated November 15, 1650, between Jean
des Carris and Jean Le Duc, binds them to assist each other to build
at common expense a ho, for each, on a clearing, of ten acres each,
made by them, and that if one of them fell sick the work should be
continued by the other without remuneration.

In the present case after the clearing had been made and the house
built on Jean des Carris' concession, the war intervening would
not allow similar work to be done on that of Jean Le Duc, and in
consequence Jean Le Duc received from his partner 580 _livres_ in
recompense for his services.

The harvest of this year was very successful; "particularly at Montreal
where the lands are very excellent," is the account in the "Relations."

It is not difficult now to present a picture of Montreal or Ville
Marie of this period. On the northeast portion of the triangular piece
of land watered on the east and north by the little River St. Peter
and on the south by the St. Lawrence, there was the fort and the new
concessions with their wooden buildings being erected thereon; on the
southern portion there was a long sweep of ground, an arpent in depth
and forty in length, along the banks of the river westward, on which
the cattle of the soldiers and others who were now becoming farmers
were allowed to stray. This was known as "the Common"[63] and was
granted to Jean de Saint Père as the syndic for the people in October,
1651, on the understanding that it should revert to the seigneurs when
they should need it for city expansion. In this common, which was
protected by the fort and the houses above, the animals, under the care
of a watchman, were safe from immediate attack, since all approaching
this pasturage must necessarily venture from afar and be visible. At
the west end of the common was the windmill near the river.[64] Across
the little river there were the houses of M. Maisonneuve and that of
the Hôtel-Dieu. This comprised the situation.

In spite of the pictures of progress and contentment we have presented
as existing towards the end of 1649 and the earlier part of 1650, we
must remember that Montreal was frequently the rendezvous of bands of
Hurons and their Jesuit missionaries, who told of their flight from the
cruelty of the Iroquois; of forts destroyed, pillaged, of burnings and
massacres. Montreal itself, they were told, was soon be the object
of attack. Hence the bands did not delay. After the horrible scenes
that had occurred at St. Louis[65] in July of 1650 the missionaries
brought down three or four hundred Lake Hurons, the relics of three
to four thousand, to Ville Marie, where they stayed only two days.
The "Relation" of this year says: "This is an advantageous situation
for the settlement of the savages, but as it is the frontier of the
Iroquois, whom our Hurons flee from, more than death itself, they could
not determine to start their colony then."

Dollier de Casson gives us this insight into the fear caused at Ville
Marie by these visits and their recitals of disaster. The evident
reflection then was, "If we who are only a handful of Europeans, do not
offer a firmer and more vigorous resistance than 30,000 Hurons have
done, then we must reconcile ourselves to be burnt alive at a slow fire
with all the refinements of unheard of cruelty."

But this year Montreal was able to breathe in comparative peace. A
picture of Montreal of this year is presented by Père P. Ragueneau, the
Jesuit superior of the missions, writing from Quebec on October 8th
to Father Picolomini, the general of the order at Rouen: "At Montreal
there are barely sixty Frenchmen, twenty Hurons, a few Algonquins and
two of our fathers. They cannot leave this fort, which is always very
much exposed."

In the spring of 1651, a perilous period began. Speaking of this year
the Jesuit "Relations" say in general: "It is a marvel that the French
of Ville Marie were not exterminated by the frequent surprises of
Iroquois bands." Other contemporaneous chroniclers repeat the same.
Sister Morin, in the "Annals of the Hôtel-Dieu of Montreal," writes:
"Often ten men of Ville Marie, or less, have been seen holding their
own against fifty or eighty Iroquois, who have acquired for themselves
a great reputation in all Canada and in France, and the Iroquois have
several times avowed that three men of Montreal have inspired them with
more fear than six from elsewhere."

The attacks now were very frequent and sudden. Although the garrison
fought well and bravely, its losses were severe compared with those of
the Iroquois, who though losing more men, yet were able to replace them.

Some of these encounters have been preserved to us. The following
occurred on May 6, 1651: On this day, Jean Boudard had left his house
with a man named Jean Chicot when suddenly they found themselves
surprised by eight or ten Iroquois. Chicot ran for safety to a tree
recently cut down and hid himself there, but Boudard, making headlong
for his home, met his wife, Catherine Mercier, not far from it. Asking
her whether the dwelling was open she replied: "No, I have locked it!"
"Ah!" cried he, "then it is death for both of us! Let us fly at once."
In their flight, the wife could not keep pace with him and, being
left behind, was seized by the Indians. Hearing her cries the husband
returned and attacked them with fisticuffs, so violently that, not
being able to master him otherwise, they massacred him on the spot.
The cries and confusion aroused three of the settlers, Charles Le
Moyne, Archambault and another, who, running to render assistance, were
seen falling into an ambuscade of forty Indians behind the hospital.
Discovering their mistake they made a retreat to the front door of the
hospital which luckily was open, having escaped a brisk fusillade, as
Le Moyne well knew by the hole in his hat. With the captive woman,
the Indians who had surprised Boudard then sought the hiding place
of Chicot. He defended himself with his feet and hands so vigorously
that fearing, lest he should be assisted by the Frenchmen they now saw
approaching, they took his scalp, taking a piece of his skull with
it. This they carried with them as a trophy, as well as the head of
Boudard, who was commonly known as "Grand Jean." Jean Chicot did not
die, however, till nearly fourteen years later, but Catherine Mercier
was brutally burned after having been inhumanly disfigured,[66] during
the summer of the same year in the Iroquois camp.

Four days later another alarm aroused the fort. About two hours after
midnight, a band of forty Iroquois attacked the brewery and some of the
houses. Two of these, belonging to Urbain Tessier _dit_ Lavigne and
Michel Chauvin, they burned, and the brewery would have been reduced to
ashes if the guard of four men within, had not repulsed their attack
with vigour and put them to flight.

On the 18th of June, on a Sunday morning, a party of four, probably
returning to their newly constructed houses from the church in the
fort, was surprised between the fort and Point St. Charles by a large
body of Iroquois. These four ran to a hut used as a kind of watch house
or redoubt, overlooking a quantity of felled timber, where they were
quickly joined by Urbain Tessier and, resolving to sell their lives
dearly, they kept up a lively fusillade on the enemy.

The noise attracted de Maisonneuve in camp and he sent a relief party
under Charles Le Moyne with such success that the Iroquois were put
to flight, leaving behind them twenty-five to thirty men dead on the
field, independently of those who were taken prisoners. On the French
side only four were wounded, although one of them, Léonard Lucault
_dit_ Barbot, died two days afterwards, being buried in the cemetery.
Belmont, in his "Histoire du Canada," mentions another among the dead,
but the parish register only mentions one.

Thus, amid such daily hostilities, was life insecurely led by the
settlers, since it was not safe to venture even a few yards from their
houses without pistol, musket or sword.

Jeanne Mance, in a memoir to be found among the archives of the
seminary at Quebec, tells how the governor now obliged all the
colonists to leave their newly constructed houses and retire with their
families to the safety of the fort. She herself was forced to leave the
hospital. Maisonneuve turned this into a military outpost to guard the
isolated redoubts scattered here and there in the field and to protect
the workmen, by placing in it a squad of soldiers. He had two pieces of
cannon taken there and swivel guns for the windows of the granaries,
and he had loopholes cut into the walls of the building all around,
even in the chapel which served as an artillery armoury.

In this way the hospital became a fortress for four years and a half.
On July 26th the wisdom of Maisonneuve's arrangement was evident.
Marguerite Bourgeoys is responsible for the story. On this day 200
Iroquois had concealed themselves in a trench originally built as a
defence for the hospital, and which, descending from a height nearby,
close to the place where St. Jean Baptiste street is today, crossed the
site of St. Paul street.

All of a sudden the concealed foes disclosed their presence by
attempting to take possession of the building and to set it on fire.
Meanwhile the garrison within, consisting of Lambert Closse,[67]
the town major, and sixteen of his men made a vigorous and valorous
defence against the 200 from 6 o'clock in the morning to 6 at night,
and losing only one man, Denis Archambault, who met his death by a
splinter from the cast iron cannon which had exploded, killing him on
the spot, but without dealing death to the enemy outside. The cannon
was fired by himself. Finally the enemy were forced to retreat, burning
a neighbouring house in revenge for their loss of men.

Other engagements of a like nature took place but the details have
not been recorded. Three Rivers and Quebec were in similar straits.
Disaster, loss, and want of reinforcement for two years had reduced
Montreal to but about fifty defenders, so that there was now open talk
of abandoning it and leaving Canada.

One hope remained, suggested to the governor by Jeanne Mance; it was
that the 22,000 _livres_ put aside as the revenue for the hospital
might be diverted to the expense of sending out a reinforcement to
save Montreal, and she thought that she might interpret her "unknown
benefactress'" goodwill as agreeable to this, seeing the extremity in
which Montreal now stood.

But de Maisonneuve accepted the offer only on the condition that in
exchange Mademoiselle Mance should receive for the hospital 100 arpents
of the domain of the seigneurs. Meanwhile he could go to France and
call on the unknown benefactress herself whose name was now divulged
to him. Mademoiselle Mance tells how "M. de Maisonneuve determined on
departing for France, told me that if he could not obtain at least 100
men, he would return no more to Ville Marie; and in this case he would
order me to return to France with all our party." Thus the abandonment
of the settlement was now threatened.

Before leaving M. de Maisonneuve named the nephew of Louis
d'Ailleboust, M. Charles d'Ailleboust, Sieur des Musseaux, to be the
governor of Montreal in his stead.

In the meantime the new governor general, M. de Lauson, of whom we
have spoken already, had arrived on October 13th to succeed M. Louis
d'Ailleboust at Quebec. This was no good tidings for Montreal, for
as Dollier de Casson remarks, the new governor made known "his good
feelings towards the Messieurs de Montréal" and the good treatment they
ought to hope from him by retrenching 1,000 from the 4,000 _livres_
granted by the general Company for the upkeep of the governor and his
garrison.[68]

"I do not wish," says he, "to say anything touching the conduct of
this gentleman towards this island, more especially as I wish to
believe that he has always had the very best of intentions, although
he was always wise to his own interest since if he had more frequently
strengthened the embankment here, the Iroquois inundations would not
have so easily taken their course towards Quebec and they would not
have done the mischief they did, for they have not always respected
even his own family."

De Maisonneuve before leaving for France persuaded the governor of
Quebec to send ten men as a reinforcement to Ville Marie. Dollier de
Casson, the quondam soldier now priest, treating this quaintly as
follows, says facetiously that de Lauson kept his promise, "sending
their arms in advance," meaning that he sent none at all. This is
confirmed by M. de Belmont, who says that "M. de Lauson sent, in
spite of his own wish, ten soldiers without arms and provisions."
"But he sent them so late," says Dollier, probably on the testimony
of eye-witnesses, "and put them on a chaloupe so poorly clad that
they almost froze to death, and they were taken for living spectres
coming, as mere skeletons, to confront the hardships of the winter. It
was a rather surprising thing to see them arrive in this turnout at
this season, considering that it was the 10th of December; so much so
that it seemed doubtful whether they were men or not, this only being
cleared up when they were seen close at hand; moreover in constitution
these men were most sickly, two of them being mere boys, though in
truth they have become since very good settlers, of whom one is called
Saint Ange and the other, Lachapelle. These poor soldiers were no
sooner here than their hosts proceeded to warm them up as well as they
could, by giving them good cheer and good clothing, and then they came
to be of service in repelling the Iroquois whom we had to deal with at
close quarters every day."

Surely Montreal must have been looked upon as a forlorn hope!


NOTE

THE EXPLOIT OF PLACE D'ARMES

The site of this is claimed by the Abbé Rousseau in his "Maisonneuve,"
page 77, as the space in front of the fort known as the Place d'Armes,
afterwards the market place and now known as Custom House Square, and
the road abutting the new buildings of the Hôtel-Dieu arising at the
corner of St. Joseph Street (St. Sulpice) and the corner of St. Paul
Street.

The Abbé Faillon, Vol. II, page 25, "Histoire de la Colonie Française,"
argues for the present Place d'Armes in front of Notre Dame Parish
Church. M. L. A. Huguet Latour, the first editor of the _Annuaire de
Ville Marie_, holds the same view.

There was a blazed trail, running up the slope of St. Sulpice Street,
which probably went up to the mountain where de Maisonneuve placed his
cross. In a map of 1680 such a road ran by the northwest corner of the
present Place d'Armes.

Faillon claims it was here that the exploit took place; the argument
of time and distance for the action as related by de Casson being more
congruous for this position than at the lower position just outside the
fort in the sight of the defenders within. But it must be remembered
that the present _Place d'Armes_ did not get its name from this
exploit. This name does not appear till 1717, when Chassegros de Léry,
engineer of New France, forwarded to France a lengthy report as to
the advantage of Montreal for the purposes of fortifications. In this
report he said:

"I have marked a _place d'armes_, in front of the parish church where
might afterwards be moved a number of barracks, the houses which are in
that place being of small value."

During the year the work was commenced, but from lack of funds it was
discontinued. Up to 1721 no further progress was made but in that
year it was fairly entered upon and de Léry superintended it. (_Vide_
"Canadiana," Vol. I, pp. 47, 63, 77; notes of John Talon Lespérance,
Henry Platt, Wm. McLennan.)

Let us compromise and say that most of the action took place on St.
Sulpice Street, between the present and the old _Place d'Armes_,
the latter incidents of the story taking place near the old _Place

     MOYNE AND ANONTAHA TO PARLEY FOR PEACE--A PATCHED UP PEACE--THE
     END OF THE SECOND IROQUOIS WAR.


M. de Maisonneuve was absent for nearly three years and during that
time Montreal was in a critical position. The inhabitants were cooped
up within the fortress or in the Hôtel-Dieu for fear of the Iroquois.
The danger of going out of these limits was only too clearly seen when
the cattle guardian, Antoine Roos, was slain at his work on the common
in front, on May 26th.

Anxiety was felt as to M. de Maisonneuve's success in Paris. News was
accordingly eagerly awaited. Thus it was that in June Jeanne Mance
went to Three Rivers under the escort of Major Closse and proceeded on
the way to Quebec under that of M. Duplessis Kerbodot, the governor
of Three Rivers. On arriving there she had almost dared to hope to
hear that M. de Maisonneuve had already arrived, but instead a long
letter awaited her. In this, the governor related his visit to Madame
de Bullion, telling how he had approached Madame adroitly, without
discovering to her his knowledge of her benefactions as the founder of
the Hôtel-Dieu. Not only did this lady not take any steps to show her
disapproval of Mademoiselle Mance's action in making the exchange of
the hospital revenue, but she gave in addition 20,000 _livres_ more
as an anonymous gift, placing it in the hands of the president of the
Company of Montreal, M. de Lamoignon, for the purpose of raising a
convoy for Montreal under M. de Maisonneuve. Thus, in all, this good
lady had contributed 42,000 towards the 75,000 _livres_ for the new
expedition of 115 men provided by the Company. The letter then informed
Mademoiselle Mance that he would return the next year; meanwhile the
preparations would be hastened.

With this good news Jeanne Mance returned as soon as possible to
Montreal. New hope was thus infused into the settlement. On July 29th,
however, the state of hostilities is again revealed to us by the record
of the brave exploit of Martine Messier, the wife of Antoine Primot.

Three Iroquois, who had hidden themselves in the wheat at a distance
of two musket shots from the fort, fell upon her unexpectedly. She
defended herself like a lioness, fighting with her hands and feet. To
quell her loud cries for help they gave her three or four stunning
blows with their axes. Thinking her dead, as she sank to the ground,
one of them threw himself over the prostrate body to take her scalp
as his trophy, when suddenly our Amazon, coming to herself, raised
herself, more furious than ever, seized him with such violence "par un
endroit que la pudeur nous défend de nommer," that he could not free
himself, although he did not cease striking her with the head of the
axe. But she held on tightly, until at last she fell to the ground
exhausted, thus affording her assailant what he most wanted at that
moment, an opportunity to escape from the relief party now running from
all parts of the fort to her rescue.

On reaching the spot where the poor woman lay bathed in her blood,
one of the men assisting her to rise, moved by a natural sentiment of
friendship and compassion, embraced her. But this seems to have made
her confused, for she administered a sound slap in the face of this
affectionate sympathizer, to the great surprise of the bystanders, who
exclaimed: "What are you doing? This man was only showing his sympathy
to you, without any thought of ill. Why do you strike him?"

"Par menda!" she exclaimed in her _patois_. "I thought he wanted to
kiss me!"

Madame Primot did not die, but she was long afterwards known as
"Parmenda," whose valour and modesty were lovingly held in tradition,
as typical of the noble women of these early pioneering days, in which
virtue and courage flourished side by side.

(By Philippe Hébert.)]

The severe treatment received at Montreal turned the Iroquois to Three
Rivers, and in a skirmish on August 19th they killed the governor, M.
Duplessis Kerbodot.

In October, however, Montreal was the scene of fresh fighting. Dollier
de Casson has rescued the story of this from oblivion, from so many
others not recorded.

On the 19th of this month, the barking of the dogs indicated the
direction of an Iroquois ambuscade. The brave town major, Lambert
Closse, ever ready to fly to the post of peril, started out at once
with twenty-four armed men to reconnoitre the situation. But though
brave, he was prudent; he therefore sent three of his soldiers ahead.
La Lochetière,[69] Baston (or Bastoin) and another, ordering them to
proceed within gunshot no further than a certain position marked out by
him. La Lochetière, however, in his eagerness pushed a little ahead of
his companions, and the more easily to discover the whereabouts of the
enemy, he climbed a tree, intending to discover from this lookout if
the enemy were hiding in a thicket.

But, without him knowing it, there was an ambush of them at the foot
of the tree, and as soon as he had climbed it they raised their usual
war cry, and were about to fire on him. No less alert than brave, La
Lochetière seized his musket, fired straight at one of them, who was
aiming at himself, killing his man, but paying the penalty of death
at the same instant from his victim's gun. The other two scouts also
received a volley, from which they were lucky to escape.

Major Chase quickly put his men in order, but, finding his party
surrounded, he directed them to make a rush to a wretched shack near
at hand, belonging to an old settler, M. Prud'homme, who had eagerly
invited them to enter as quickly as possible, for the enemy were
surrounding it. This done, the party made loopholes in the walls for
their guns and prepared to open a brisk fire on the besiegers--all
except one coward, who, falling flat on the ground, could not be
induced by threats or blows to rise. But the Iroquois were now firing
at close quarters all around the house and their balls riddled the
scanty walls so that one of them struck Laviolette, one of the fighters
of the fort, completely disabling him. The loopholes now being ready,
the French party answered the Iroquois with such effect that after
the first rounds the ground was strewn with the dusky bodies of the
slain. The hurly-burly went on, the Iroquois fighting while they
attempted to carry away their wounded and dead, until, fearing a dearth
of ammunition, Major Closse was only too glad to accept the offer of
Baston, whose prowess as a runner was well known, to make a dash to the
fort and bring back a reinforcement of men.

Accordingly, under cover of the fire of the defenders of the house, the
door was opened and Baston, speeding forth, escaped while the Iroquois
were recovering from this last fusillade.

Soon he returned with eight or ten men, all that could be spared, and
two pieces of cannon charged with canister shot. Between the scene of
battle and the fort there was a screen of trees under cover of which
the reinforcement made its way and thus escaped the attention of the
savages till it suddenly appeared in view on this side of the screen
and commenced firing on the Iroquois. Major Closse's party now went
into the open to join fire also and a brisk and hot interchange took
place. But the enemy were being overmastered and made their best to
retreat, carrying with them their dead as far as possible, according to
their custom. Dollier de Casson does not give the number of the enemy
slain. "Usually," he says, "they decimated their losses, but, speaking
of this occasion, they owned that 'we all died there.'"

M. de Belmont in his history states that more than fifty of the
Iroquois were wounded and twenty killed. On the French side the only
one killed was La Lochetière, and one wounded, Laviolette.

This was only one of the brave actions which surrounded the fame of the
warlike Lambert Closse as revealed in the early chronicles.

[Illustration: LAMBERT CLOSSE

(By Philippe Hébert)]

Thus the fort of Montreal was the scene of many such conflicts,
unassisted by the "camp volant," which de Lauson had suppressed in
1652. Père Mercier, in his "Relations of the Year 1653," writes:
"There has passed no month of the year in which the Iroquois have not
stealthily visited Ville Marie, attempting to surprise it. But they
have had no great success. The settlers have assisted one another with
so much determination and courage that as soon as a gunshot is heard
in any direction, they run thither quickly, without any dread of the
dangers besetting them."

At Quebec, it was announced that Montreal had been blotted out.
In the spring of 1653 the governor of Quebec, anxious for news of
this advanced post, had sent a barque thither, giving the commander
instructions that he should not approach the fort, unless he had
proof certain that the French were there, adding that if he did not
see any, he was to come back to Quebec, for fear that the Iroquois,
having captured Ville Marie, might be lying in ambush to capture them
also. The barque advanced near the fort in a dense fog, and anchored.
But seeing no one and hearing no signal, they obeyed their instructions
literally enough, and went back to Quebec with the dire tale of the
destruction of the French colonists. The wiseacres no doubt said that
the inevitable had occurred at last.

Meanwhile in the fort, the keen-eyed had seen the vague outline of a
vessel, but others said it was a phantom of the imagination, and when
later the mist rolled away and they saw no ship, these were satisfied
with their diagnosis until news came later from Quebec that it was a
veritable vessel after all.

In this abandoned state, we are told by the chroniclers how the
Montrealers, under the direction of the Jesuits of the fort, earnestly
prayed for peace.

As if in answer to their petition, on June 26, 1653, an embassy of
sixty Iroquois of the nation of the Onondagas (Onontaquis) appeared
at the fort with a proposal of peace. As they came unarmed, they were
treated kindly, presents were exchanged, and the day was one of public
rejoicing. On returning to their country, passing by the village of the
Oneidas (Onneyuts), they exhibited their presents and spoke in high
praise of the French of Montreal. "They are devils when attacked,"
they said, "but most courteous and affable when treated as friends."
And they protested that they were about to enter into a firm and solid
alliance with them. Touched by these discourses, the Oneida Iroquois
(Onneyuts) would also enter into an alliance with Montreal, and they
sent an embassy with a great porcelain necklace, asking for peace,
which was concluded. But there were three others of the Five Nations
who had not made peace, for though they were allied amongst themselves
they reserved their independence. These were the Mohawks (Agniers), the
Senecas (the Tsonnoutouans), and the Cayugas (Gogogouins).

Three weeks after this, 600 Mohawks marched on Montreal. We have no
records of this attack, but they retired to Three Rivers to seize the
port there. Quebec now also trembled for itself, and it was at this
time that de Lauson reestablished the "camp volant." In September of
this year peace was again concluded, for a time, between the French and
the Iroquois. As Montreal had a large share in bringing this about we
must relate the following circumstances leading to it.

At the time of the descent, of the Iroquois above mentioned, on
Montreal, there was present in the fort a band of Hurons, and among
them one, the bravest of all, named Anontaha. On one occasion these
Hurons had discovered the tracks of a party of lurking Iroquois
meditating mischief for Montreal. They combined with the French
and on August 25th they surrounded the Iroquois, and after a sharp
struggle beat them off, leading four or five Iroquois chiefs, or men of
importance, to the fort. These captives told of the projected raids of
extermination on Three Rivers and Quebec. The acting governor, knowing
of the importance of these Iroquois in the camp, called a meeting of
his counsellors, and it was determined that Charles Le Moyne, the
interpreter, should persuade Anontaha to go to Three Rivers and parley
for peace with the Iroquois, offering to hand them over their chiefs
in captivity in Montreal. This was done on August 24th and peace was
concluded later. Dollier de Casson says of this: "Finally there was
made a sudden patched-up peace in which our enemies acquiesced, solely
to regain their own people and to have an opportunity of surprising us
later. We well knew their rascally motives, but, as they were stronger
than we, we accepted their conditions, 'et en passions par là où ils
voulaient.'"

Thus ended the second Iroquois war.

The arrival of M. de Maisonneuve's expedition was eagerly awaited by
the whole French colony of Canada. For the addition of newcomers, men
able to bear arms, meant more resources against the common enemy, and
consequently surer stability for the whole French population.

The picture presented at this period of war is distressing. Montreal
was a besieged fortress; Three Rivers similarly, and the Town of Quebec
was described, on the arrival of de Maisonneuve, as only holding five
or six houses in Upper Town, while in the Lower there were only the
storehouses of the Jesuits and that of Montreal. The "Relation" of 1653
says "that the store of Montreal has not bought a single beaver skin
for a year. At Three Rivers, the little sold has gone to strengthen
the fortifications. At Quebec, there is only poverty." Thus there was
extreme discontent through inability to pay private debts or those due
to the government for the upkeep of the colony, which by the cession
of the trading rights to the people now devolved upon them and not on
the great Company. Thus they looked for a continuation of the peace
just declared and a return to trade. It was hoped that Maisonneuve's
contingent would make for both. Consequently it was with great joy and
a solemn _Te Deum_ in the church that its arrival at Quebec was hailed
on September 22nd. The governor of Montreal and his new colonists were
the saviours of the country!

We may now briefly relate the history of the organization of this
relief force. When de Maisonneuve had made sure of the necessary funds,
he proceeded with M. de la Dauversière, the procurator of the Company
of Montreal, to gather the right men. They must be young, brave, have
a trade, be of irreproachable morals, and able to bear arms; in other
words, be ready to help to found and organize a settlement, and put up
with the variety of trying difficulties incidental to such a dangerous
pioneering outpost. These men were hired for the work, and they
guaranteed their services to the Company for five years at Montreal,
on the condition of being fed and lodged, in addition to wages paid
them, besides being provided with tools, etc., for the exercise of
their callings. After the five years expired, they might return to
France at the expense of the Company. These were recruited from
Picardy, Champagne, Normandy, L'Ile de France, Touraine, Burgundy, but
principally from Maine and Anjou, and especially from the neighbourhood
of La Flèche, the home of M. de la Dauversière.

We are able to locate the origin and point out the profession of
nearly each one of those coming with Maisonneuve's force, since we
have the old original acts of Notary Lafousse, of La Flèche, giving
the contracts between 118 of the men and the agents of the Company
of Montreal, signed during the course of March, April and May of
1653. There were 38 others who signed in other places, making the
total, according to Faillon, of 154, all able to bear arms. Of these,
some deserted, some died on the passage out, and, according to M. de
Belmont, only 105 reached Montreal.[70] But these were all picked men
and chosen with care; there were three surgeons, three millers, two
bakers, a brewer, a cooper, a coppersmith, a pastry cook, four weavers,
a tailor, a hatter, three shoemakers, a maker of sabots, a cutler, two
armourers, three masons, a stonecutter, four tilers, nine carpenters,
two joiners, an edgetool maker, a nail maker, a saw maker, a paviour,
two gardeners, a farrier, sixty tillers or labourers for cultivating
the soil, of whom several were sawyers, etc.

The absence of womankind is noticeable in this list, but a few ladies
were provided for the settlement in this way. Before the day for the
departure, fixed for June 20, 1653, de Maisonneuve visited his sisters,
Madame de Chuly and la Soeur Louise de Ste. Marie, who both lived
at Troyes, the latter being a nun of the Congregation of Notre-Dame
there, to bid them adieu. It will be remembered that the good nuns of
Troyes were very anxious to emulate the example of the Ursulines of
Quebec by sending representatives of their order to Montreal to found
an establishment there. De Maisonneuve had promised to make use of
their offer of services, when the time should be ready, but no one who
has followed the story of the chequered days of the city so far, will
blame the governor of Montreal for still refusing to receive as yet a
cloistered nunnery in his beleaguered fort. But there happened to be
a young woman of thirty-three years of age then living with Madame de
Chuly at Troyes, a lay woman belonging to a pious association under the
direction of the Sisters of the Congregation, who had long heard of the
thrilling story of the doings at Ville Marie from Madame de Chuly and
the ladies of the convent. She had, indeed, communicated her idea to
de Maisonneuve's sister, of devoting herself to the work in Montreal,
so that Marguerite Bourgeoys, as was her name, had been promised to be
received into their institute when they should realize their project of
going to Canada.

It was then, in the convent _parloir_, that the good nuns introduced
this young person to de Maisonneuve, who doubtless asked her kindly,
gravely and courteously, if she dared brave the ocean and live in a
little settlement among rough soldiers and teach school to little
Indian children of the forests, and make Christians of them, and thus
do good work for God. Needless to say his offer was accepted. All
necessary permissions were granted,[71] but Marguerite momentarily
hesitated to give herself to the conduct of a strange gentleman whom
she had only met on this occasion.

"Fear not, my child," was the reply of her spiritual adviser, who knew
the integrity of the upright governor. "Put yourself in his hands as
into those of one of the first knights of the Queen of Angels. Go to
Ville Marie with all confidence."

Thus she arrived at St. Nazaire, the port of departure, near Nantes;
but to her great surprise and pleasure she found a small group of her
own sex to accompany her on the voyage--several young girls, and one or
two married women accompanying their husbands. The expedition started
on June 20th in the Saint Nicholas de Nantes, and barely had it made
150 leagues on its way than it was found necessary to put back to St.
Nazaire, for the ship's timbers were rotten and she made water fast.
At first it was thought, with so many hands on board, that by working
at the pumps they could proceed, there being then over one hundred men
of the Montreal party. But "having turned back at last, when they were
nearing land they would have perished," says Marguerite Bourgeoys,
"without the succour which, by the grace of God, the people of this
place (St. Nazaire) gave us."

In the Annals of the Hôtel-Dieu, an instance is related as occurring
on this voyage which illustrates the character of simplicity of M.
de Maisonneuve, with whom Marguerite Bourgeoys was now to become
acquainted. Madame de Chuly had taken care to provide her brother
with a wardrobe of very fine linen and such lace work as gentlemen of
position then wore. It happened that a few days after the ship had set
sail, the package which Marguerite Bourgeoys had made of these was
swept into the sea and, despite all her efforts, she was unable to
recover it.

Not knowing M. de Maisonneuve's character, and fearing that this loss,
which could not be repaired in Canada, might grieve a gentleman of
fashion such as she considered M. de Maisonneuve might be, she told
him of the misfortune with great apprehension, but to her relief the
governor of Montreal made light of it, laughingly remarking that
"both he and she were well rid of the care of such vanities." Later
Marguerite Bourgeoys was to learn of his extreme simplicity in all that
surrounded his private life.

Marguerite tells how M. de Maisonneuve on putting back to St. Nazaire
placed all his soldiers on a small island nearby to prevent them from
deserting, for they now feared the journey, having become excited and
alarmed and believing "they were being led to perdition." Some of them
threw themselves into the waves to escape. Another ship was chartered,
and set sail on July 20th, taking up the men from the island. But
soon fresh disaster--"ship" fever--broke out and many were laid low.
In these days of commodious sailing in a well appointed and sanitary
steamer that takes less than a week to come from Europe to Canada we
do not realize sufficiently the hardships of the early immigrant days.
This voyage took two months; the ship, maybe, a crazy tub of a sailing
vessel--the overcrowded accommodation of the most primitive order;
the provisions of the coarsest kind, and water scarce. Can we wonder
that before the journey ended we learn that out of the 113 men hired
by the Company of Montreal, eight had died? We may well imagine the
great grief of de Maisonneuve, for every man to him was a cherished
possession.

This period brought out the sterling character of Marguerite Bourgeoys,
who undertook the care of the nursing. Throughout the sickness she was
indefatigable, taking the men their meals, assisting the surgeons,
preparing the men for death, and nursing the others into convalescence.
Night and day she was lavish of her charity. It is related that she
would not accept a place with de Maisonneuve's party at table, but
would take her food and whatever delicacies there might be given by
them to distribute among the sufferers, while she herself was satisfied
with the common rations, and scarce portions at that.

Her zeal knew no relaxation, for, whether in sickness or in health, the
soldiers welcomed her as their nurse, their friend, their instructress,
their leader at the morning and night prayers, and singing and
spiritual reading. Thus she laid the foundations of that lasting
respect which the men of Montreal ever had for her.

At last the hoped-for recruitment reached the enfeebled garrison of
Quebec on September 22nd. There was Mademoiselle Jeanne Mance awaiting
the vessel to receive M. de Maisonneuve, to tell him of the perilous
fate of Montreal and to hear from him all the news of the good things
in store for it, for she was keen to hurry back to carry the glad
tidings thither.

We can imagine the courtly Maisonneuve now introducing to the lady of
the Hôtel-Dieu the new assistant that she was to have in the care and
training of the young of Montreal, Marguerite Bourgeoys of Troyes, whom
she would find of good sense and kindly heart, a virtuous and excellent
companion, and a powerful aid for the good work in the settlement. Thus
began an enduring friendship between these noble women.

It will be noticed that at this second foundation of Montreal, which
is now about to begin, history repeats itself. M. de Lauson, seeing
Quebec in its own dire necessity of defenders, would now prevent M.
de Maisonneuve from taking his convoy up country. But the governor of
Montreal firmly insisted on carrying out the project and he would not
leave behind him a single man of those who had cost the Company of
Montreal so much.

Moreover, Maisonneuve had a _lettre de cachet_ which the King, Louis
XIV, had granted the Company of Montreal on April 8, 1653, in which
he approved of the renewed appointment of Maisonneuve as governor,
giving him all power to continue the establishment of the settlement at
Montreal.

Thus silenced, the governor of Quebec could only resist by refusing
to provide transportation facilities by river. Thus it was that the
necessity of obtaining boats delayed Maisonneuve at Quebec for a
month. Meanwhile Marguerite nursed those still sick from the voyage
and presided over the distribution of the stores and the provisions as
Jeanne Mance had done in 1641.

It was during this time that the Ursulines of Quebec made overtures
to her to join their party; thus they thought that they might have a
branch establishment in Montreal.[72] But the future schoolmistress of
Montreal already saw her own vocation clearly before her. At length
the boats were ready and Maisonneuve sailed, last of all, with the
satisfaction of seeing that he did not leave one of his men behind him.
Ville Marie was reached on November 16, 1653.

On reaching Montreal, de Maisonneuve set about the work of
consolidating his colony. The elements he had chosen in his contingent
of 105 men, who, together with those already on the ground, formed
the nucleus of his future city, had in them the potentialities of a
well-constituted and progressive civic society. They were of different
trades, so that mutual help of a diversified nature could be given,
albeit they were all soldiers in that they each bore arms, ready to
build up the City of God, even as the builders of the temple of old had
gone about their work with trowel in one hand and sword in the other.
He found his men, whom the hardships of the journey may have daunted,
now enthusiastic for the ideal Christian life opening up to them and
disposed to make a permanent home with him. Consequently, in the course
of December they were ready to listen at the Sunday services, in the
fort chapel, to his overtures, made in the public announcements before
the sermon, stating the terms on which those that were willing to
forego their contract of remaining only for five years and then being
taken back to France, might be encouraged to build their permanent
homes and take up land.

The governor's intention was to induce them to abandon the advances
of money made in France, and later, on their arrival in Canada, on
condition of building their houses on an arpent of land granted on the
site chosen for the town and cultivating thirty acres on the slopes
of St. Louis or St. Joseph, in the vicinity, with the additional
consideration of a certain sum of money to provide the means to settle,
the latter sum being forfeited if they should ever quit the Island of
Montreal.

On the first day of January, 1654, André Demers thus received 400
_livres_ and two days afterwards Jean des Carris and Jean Le Duc
received 900 on the above promise, soon to be followed in the same
month and that of February by many others on similar terms. These sums
may seem modest, but it was an age of simplicity and they were adequate.

The wooden homes the settlers built on their one arpent were of the
simplest, and on the arrival of the last immigration there was much
activity in felling and carpentering. They assisted one another in
building their little houses of thirty feet, and the bachelors lived
in common till they had built their own homes or "shacks," as the
contracts prove.

The number of houses outside the fort began to grow. M. de Maisonneuve
increased the buildings of the hospital, and Jeanne Mance went back
to live there, protected from the Iroquois attacks by two redoubts he
had constructed hard by, in which were placed two pieces of cannon and
other artillery. The houses of the _habitants_ were built detached from
one another, but clustered, facing one another for mutual protection.
In the walls they had loopholes made so that each home was a fortress
with armed men inside. By 1659 there were about forty of these. The
fort began to be abandoned. Repairs were neglected on the bastions,
already battered by the ice shoves. Soon it sheltered the governor, the
d'Ailleboust family, the town major and his ordinary garrison, and some
others, among whom was Marguerite Bourgeoys.

The lands cultivated were mostly on the St. Louis slopes, and to
protect them Maisonneuve built a redoubt of twenty feet square and
sixteen in height, with a chimney. In 1654 he built another in this
section and gave the workers an indemnity of 300 _livres_.

All were very busy at their trades, for everything now had to be made
"in Canada." No one disdained manual labor, following the example of
the governor and d'Ailleboust and others, such as the town major,
Lambert Closse; Charles Le Moyne, interpreter and storekeeper for the
Company; the Notary Saint Père. Gilbert Barbier, the carpenter, who
was now dignified as fiscal procurator and justice of the peace, had
a busy time superintending and lending a hand to the rapidly arising
homesteads.

On their side, the women were not less engaged, baking the bread and
preparing the meals, combing the wool, spinning and weaving and making
the simple garments. Thirteen years later, when Marguerite Bourgeoys
formed her first community of two helpers, Marie Barbier, daughter of
Gilbert, the first Canadian girl to be received into the Congregation
of Notre-Dame of Montreal, could be seen in her religious habit going
to and from the pasturage grounds of the common, leading the cattle
and often bearing on her shoulders the flour which she had previously
taken as wheat to be ground at the mill. In similar attire could have
been seen Sister Crolo, tending the farm. And when not thus occupied,
Marguerite Bourgeoys and her companions were busy sewing and cutting,
to clothe the women and natives.

But in 1654 Marguerite Bourgeoys, the future schoolmistress, had not
gathered her community together, and she was not overburdened in this
office, for there was only one French girl, Jeanne Loisel, who, born
in Montreal on July 21, 1649, was now about 4-1/2 years of age. This
girl, who remained with Marguerite Bourgeoys till she was married, was
the first child to live to any age. For hitherto all that had been
born had died in their tender years. One child, the adopted daughter
of Parmenda, who had been born a year before coming to Montreal, had,
however, prospered, and she was shortly to be married, as we shall see.

The contracts of marriage, preserved in the city archives of this
period, gave an insight in the life of the time. The contract of
marriage of Louis Prud'homme with Roberte Gadois reveals that her
father gave his daughter, besides the sum of 500 _livres_, a complete
bed, fifty ells of silk, a cow and its calf, six dishes, six plates and
a pewter pot--luxuries in these primitive times.[73]

In a contract of the year 1650, we find that the bridegroom, of
well-to-do means, as a gift to his bride, gave, in his marriage
settlement, the sum of fifty to sixty _livres_ and his residence in
his principal house; and on her part she would bring her dowry of 500
_livres_.

Up to 1654 there had been only ten marriages between the French
settlers, the first having taken place in 1647, after the return of
Maisonneuve on his first visit to France, when he brought with him for
this purpose "some virtuous young women." Marriages flourished again
in 1650, when Jeanne Mance also returned with some eligible partners.
We find in November of this year that Louis Prud'homme, of whom we
have spoken, married Roberte Gadois; and Gilbert Barbier, Catherine de
Lavaux. In 1651 the notary, Jean Saint Père, married Maturine Godé,
the daughter of Nicholas Godé, whose family came over with Maisonneuve
at the first foundation of Montreal. On the occasion of his marriage,
in recompense "for his good and faithful service rendered during eight
years," Maisonneuve, in addition to the gift of forty arpents, promised
him six arpents of land, to be cultivated by him, meanwhile granting
him the enjoyment of six others already tilled near to the fort.

In 1654 there were naturally more marriages, and thirteen are therefore
registered. Of these early marriages, especially of this year, there
are many descendants still living.

Thus for some time Marguerite Bourgeoys, with the exception of Jeanne
Loisel, would have to exercise her care with Jeanne Mance in assisting
the newly-born children, visiting the sick, consoling the afflicted,
washing the linen or mending the clothing of the poor and the soldiers,
burying the dead and following the call of self-sacrifice everywhere.
Otherwise she dwelt within the fort with M. de Maisonneuve, looking
after his domestic arrangements, in a position of friendship and trust
but not of domestic service. Indeed, with Jeanne Mance she became his
wise adviser, for both seemed to have been largely consulted in the
affairs of the settlement.

It will be remembered that Marguerite Bourgeoys, who had taken a vow of
perpetual chastity in France, had been heard to place herself in the
hands of M. de Maisonneuve as in those of "one of the first Chevaliers
of the Angels."

Scrutiny into the life of de Maisonneuve, a "chevalier sans reproche,"
reveals us a singularly pure character. About this time the governor
had doubts whether he should take a wife, but, not feeling himself
called to the married state, he took, according to custom of the time,
a vow of virginity, so that his biographers speak of him as being a
religious without the habit. He was a man of prayer and devoted to
duty, sincere, unaffected and unostentatious, seeking neither praise
nor flattery, and undepressed by slights and contradictions. His life
ideals were high and saintly, and his whole conduct was that of a
Christian knight, a model to all under him. His household was simply
furnished; his table was frugal; he had only one servant, and this
man was the cook and general servant. In his dress ordinarily he
followed the habits of the people, wearing the _tuque_, or _capot_, and
grey tunic which have come down to us in some of the costumes of the
snowshoe clubs of Montreal of today. Yet, not unmindful of his dignity
as governor, on important occasions he would be habited as fitting his
rank as a soldier and a gentleman.

He never strove to make his post serve to increase his fortune,
although, like his lieutenants, he could have legitimately traded in
peltry, then beginning to be very profitable. He seems rather to have
embraced the "Lady Poverty" and to have been singularly unselfish
and altruistic. Dollier de Casson tells us, as an example of his
magnanimity and generosity, how, ever ready to recompense the good
actions of his soldiers, he would deprive himself of his provisions,
even those on his own table, to give them away. "On one occasion," says
this historian, "when the savages came to trade at this place, noticing
that one of his soldiers who had often given proofs of courage against
the enemy was in extreme depression, and having found out on enquiry
that it was caused by having nothing to trade with the Indians who
were then here, he thereupon led him into his own room, and, since the
man was a tailor, gave him all the cloth stuffs he could find, even to
the curtains of his bed, to make into wearing apparel which he might
sell to the Indians." Thus he sent the young soldier away happy. Such
generosity endeared him to his men.

The military organization of Montreal may be said to have become
solidified this year. For hitherto, beyond readiness to respond to the
call to arms, the soldier's sense of duty and _esprit de corps_ had not
been cultivated.

The governor took this work of formation into his own hands and
chose sixty-three of his most devoted men and erected a military
confraternity with the title of the "Soldiers of the Blessed Virgin."
He was proud to command these himself. These met in religious meetings
and the knightly de Maisonneuve would address them with glowing
words of encouragement to acquit themselves like good Christians and
soldiers. These were the governor's guard of honour, which came into
prominence whenever there was a great religious ceremony or civil
function, such as the reception of a distinguished visitor to the
island.

During the week, each of these in turn had the duty of sentinel,
parading the fields, on the lookout for traces of the dreaded Iroquois.
To be selected one of this military order was a high favour. One of
the privileges of this guard of honour was to escort Mademoiselle
Bourgeoys, shortly after her arrival, to the mountain to visit the
cross placed there by de Maisonneuve in 1642, but now found to have
been destroyed by the Iroquois in the recent war. It was immediately
replanted, under her direction, by Gilbert Barbier and four other men,
who placed a palisading around it. This monument was the Mecca of
pilgrimages until the occupation by the British in 1760.

The necessity of providing themselves with the needful and
indispensable objects of life stimulated the industry and inventiveness
of all, so that each man fulfilled many rôles. In addition, the spirit
of enterprise and initiative was encouraged by the cancellation of
their contracts made with the Company in France for mostly all now were
independent workers, anxious to make good for their own interests.
Still the Company had the onus of providing the public works, and the
contracts of this period show that it paid just salaries for services
rendered.

We have an insight into the medical history of the city in a contract
made by the first surgeon, Etienne Bouchard, on March 30, 1655, with
twenty-six families to treat them regularly for a certain sum. To
these were shortly added others to the number, in all, of forty-six.
This shows that the cancellation of the original contract, by which
the surgeon was appointed to give free medical treatment to all the
inhabitants, was a consequence of the new order of things.

The government of the settlement was very simple. Besides the governor,
there was a fiscal procurator or treasurer, a public notary, a keeper
of the storehouse of the Company, and a syndic.

The last named office was first filled in 1644, when Louis XIV gave
the Company of Montreal the right to erect a corporation. The syndic
was elected by a plurality of votes from the inhabitants themselves to
represent their interest and thus became a tribune of the people. He
had the privilege with those of Quebec and Three Rivers of assisting
at the election of the two councillors (or three in the absence of the
governor), who were chosen to compose the General Council of Nouvelle
France, with the governor general and the ecclesiastical superior, for
the time being, in Canada. They were even privileged to represent the
interests of their corporation at the council meetings and to have a
"voix délibérative" in these same matters.

By a royal act of 1647 the syndics could only be appointed for three
years, and by another of 1648 they could not negotiate any loan for
their corporations without the express sanction of the council at
Quebec, under pain of nullity, damages and interests incurred by the
syndics themselves.

The election of a syndic was a simple matter at Montreal. The
inhabitants had first to get the leave of the governor to call a
meeting. The public notary employed by the Company called this and
presided. Placing before the electors the names of likely persons for
the office, he called upon them to subscribe their names or their
marks to the candidate of their choice. On the votes being counted,
the person elected might refuse the honour, but the spirit of civic
duty always prompted him to respond to the call. He then promised to
discharge his duties faithfully, and the retiring syndic would hand
over to his successor the care of the documents of the corporation,
the contracts of property, etc., and other titles such as that already
granted to the syndic for the people in 1651, when forty arpents were
given over to them for a "common."

In the year 1654 it would have been the syndic who received the grant
made to the corporation by the governor on behalf of the Seigneurs of
Montreal, of land for the new cemetery, given on the condition that if
this changed its place, it should revert to the Seigneurs.

The little cemetery, in which for twelve years the first brave
defenders of the Castle Dangerous of Montreal had been buried, had
this year to be abandoned and the bodies removed to higher ground, for
the constant floods of the St. Lawrence had sadly ill used the little
palisaded God's acre at "the Point," or the corner of the junction of
the rivulet St. Pierre and the main stream.

The "new cemetery," as it was called in the burial register on the date
December 11, 1654, was placed on a portion of the ground belonging
to the Hôtel-Dieu, bun above the latter, at a point today occupied
by the southern portion of the Place d'Armes and the piazza steps of
Notre Dame Church. It was at the head of what was the second street or
tract called St. Joseph Street, and nowadays St. Sulpice, while at the
bottom, at the southwest corner bounded by St. Paul Street, was the
Hôtel-Dieu. This cemetery was used for the next twenty-four years.[74]

The expense of these changes was borne by the parishioners and not by
the Company--another sign of the times. We know this, for the salaries
paid are still to be seen in the original document in which it is
recorded that Gilbert Barbier, the carpenter who erected the cross,
gave the half of his salary as a contribution, to the church.

The church towards which Gilbert Barbier gave his donation was probably
not the mission chapel which had been so long the centre of parish life
and piety in the fort itself, but towards a new one that already, on
June 29th of this year, had been determined on to be started as soon as
possible owing to the increase of population from the reinforcement of
1653.

On this day, the feast of SS. Peter and Paul, the syndic had called
a meeting of the habitants in the presence of the governor, when
Jean Saint Père was elected by a majority of votes to act as the
"receiver of alms," or treasurer for funds for a new church. He was to
keep account of all sums given to him, with the names of the donors
and should furnish a financial statement every three months to the
governor. In addition it was ruled that all donations in grain, or in
kind, subject to deterioration, should be sold by the treasurer to the
highest bidder, provided that the auction should be publicly announced
by a notice affixed to the fort gate three days in advance of the sale.
Finally, the treasurer should hand over the sums received by him, when
required, to the director of the church building to be erected by the
citizens in the presence of the governor when there shall be need for
such an appointment. Besides the private donations M. de Maisonneuve,
as the administrator of justice, applied the court fines to the church
fund.

But it was not till August 28, 1656, that the foundations of the new
church were laid. In the meantime the people still worshiped in the
fort chapel, now become too small for its increased population through
the recent influx of the troops of soldiers and the women. It had
many dear memories symbolized by the baptisms, marriages and deaths,
and the feasts and festivals of the year. At its services the Jesuit
missionaries, such as Isaac Jogues, Poncet, Buteaux and others, had
officiated with mutilated limbs, a living instance of the ever brooding
presence of the revengeful Iroquois.[75] In this little mission chapel
many a prayer had gone forth for the relief which tardily came.

But it was too small and must give place to another--a real parish
church, large, dignified and commodious, to meet the needs of the
expanding corporation. The cherished decorations and the altar
furniture and plate, which were gifts from rich friends in France,
would still be a link between the old and the new, and thus its memory
would be kept forever green.

The old chapel church still continued its work. It witnessed, on May
28th of the year following, 1654, the marriage of Charles Le Moyne with
the adopted daughter of Antoine Primot and Martine Mercier, his wife,
whom we know as the valiant and chaste Parmenda. This girl, Catherine
Thierry, probably a niece of Madame Primot, had been brought as a
child of one year to Montreal in 1642, and she was commonly known as
Catherine Primot and was now fourteen years of age. This union begot
the famous Le Moyne family. Their first home was on the arpent town
lot near the hospital. On February 3rd the fort chapel witnessed the
marriage of Jean Gervaise and Anne Archambault, who also reared one of
the most numerous and honourable families of Montreal. This was the
fourth marriage of the thirteen occurring this year.

The history of Anne Archambault gives us an insight into one of the
few scandals of the time. This was Anne's second marriage, having
been married before the church in Quebec in July, 1647, to a Michel
Chauvin, _dit_ Ste Suzanne who had been sent out by de la Dauversière
to Montreal in the service of the Company in 1644.

In 1650 Louis Prud'homme, of whom we have made mention already, had
on a voyage to France discovered that Chauvin had deserted his wife,
and on returning to Montreal he had notified the authorities, so that
on October 8, 1650, Chauvin acknowledged freely before Jean Saint
Père, the official notary of justice, that some seven years before
leaving France for Canada he had married Louise de Liles. He then
hurriedly departed for Quebec and took the first boat back to France.
Anne Archambault had one child by this scoundrel, born on April
5th following. To sympathize with her Jeanne Mance and M. Charles
d'Ailleboust des Musseaux were the godparents.

To the great joy of the colony, Anne Archambault was honourably
remarried on February 3, 1654, to Jean Gervaise, one of the recruits
brought over by de Maisonneuve in the previous autumn. The esteem of
the public was manifested to offset the unaccustomed scandal that had
arisen in their midst. One child, Charlotte Chauvin, was reared by
these two and for this purpose the governor gave special assistance on
behalf of the Company. At this time there were also several orphans,
children of soldiers that had died in battle with the Iroquois, and for
these de Maisonneuve also provided.

Thus the spirit of fervour, charity and uprightness of morals was
exercised in the life of this primitive church of the settlement.
Sister Morin, in the Annals of the Hôtel-Dieu, writes of these early
times: "Nothing was put under key in these days, neither the houses,
chests, or cellars; everything was left open without anyone repenting
of their trustfulness. Those who were in easy circumstances hastened
to lend their assistance to others less fortunate, and gave it
spontaneously without waiting to be called upon, making it a pleasure
to forestall all needs and to give their marks of affection and esteem
to one another."

The words of Longfellow, written so long after, of Grandpré, the home
of Evangeline, might be well applied to Ville Marie at this date:

     "Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows;
     But their dwellings were open as day, and the hearts of the owners.
     There the richest were poor, and the poorest lived in abundance."


FOOTNOTES:

[70] How many of those hired sailed for Montreal? An unedited list
containing 102 names has lately been found in the archives of the
Seminary of St. Sulpice at Montreal by Mr. C. O. Bertrand, and has
been reproduced with notes by Mr. E. Z. Massicotte in the Canadian
Antiquarian and Numismatic Journal for October, 1913 (Third Series,
Vol. X). The original number of engagés, according to Faillon, taken
from the notarial contracts before Maître Lafousse at La Flèche,
was 154. But examination shows that, owing to several duplications,
this must be reduced to 150. Before sailing at St. Nazaire only 103,
according to Faillon, answered the call. But on the examination of
Faillon's list, it is seen that the number was 102, which corresponds
with the newly found list.

Marguerite Bourgeoys says that there were about 120 passengers, of whom
108 were "soldiers," as she calls the engagés. The Abbé de Belmont
gives 105 soldiers. Mr. Massicotte, from a study of the contracts of
marriages shortly after the arrival of the recruits of 1653 and other
sources, supplies the eighteen missing members thus: A married woman,
two single women, four men, M. de Maisonneuve, Marguerite Bourgeoys,
and nine others who are mentioned by the latter as "quelques filles,"
who were brought for marriageable purposes.

Marguerite Bourgeoys mentions that eight were buried at sea. Of the 102
in the list mentioned above, Mr. Massicotte finds eleven names that
never occur in any of the documents of the period at Montreal. Hence he
concludes that their owners never reached Montreal and that therefore
eight at least of them correspond to those that were buried in the
ocean.

[71] For she was now thirty-three years of age, having been born on
April 17, 1620, in the town of Troyes in Champagne. Her mother had died
when Marguerite was still young, and early she developed that motherly
thoughtfulness and mature judgment which fitted her later in the
settlement for her matronly solicitude for soldiers and children of the
fort at Montreal, as since her mother's death she had had the care of
her father's children. He, too, had lately died and she was now free to
follow a life of sacrifice.

[72] It was with the view of seeing the possibility of establishing
such a branch that Madame de la Peltrie had delayed in Montreal till
the spring of 1644.

[73] The simplicity of life in a pioneering settlement in New France
less than a century later can be more readily understood if we
but glance at the simple and severe customs prevailing in England
previously to this. It is related of Queen Elizabeth that in the
third year of her reign she received a present of knitted black silk
stockings, an unheard of thing hitherto; in 1588 she appeared, in
public, mounted on the crupper of her horse, behind her chamberlain,
for it was after this date that carriages came into vogue.

[74] The act of November 28th by Père Pijart mentions only "cemeterio,"
that is the old cemetery at Pointe à Callières. The act of December
11th, however, has clear mention of the change to the new cemetery.
"_In novo hospitalis Domus cemeterio Franciscus Lachot sepultus a me
Claudio Pijart, Societatis Jesu Sacerdote_"--In the new cemetery of the
hospital Francis Lachot was buried by me Claude Pijart, priest of the
Society of Jesus.

[75] Most of the earliest Jesuits had served them at least in passing
through, on their adventurous work of Christianizing the redskins of
Canada; of such Bancroft, the historian, has said: "Not a cape was
turned, not a river entered, but a Jesuit led the way."

The fictitious and temporary peace which had intervened when de
Maisonneuve arrived in the autumn of 1653, and had allowed the settlers
to resume the work of building their homes outside the fort, was
shortly to be broken.

Indeed, during the year just described there were not wanting
indications, early in the spring of 1654, of the renewal of
hostilities, when a young surgeon engaged in setting his beaver traps
was carried off in a canoe by the lurking Onondaga Indians. In the
beginning of May a band of the same Iroquois, who had not heard of
this act of perfidy, were well received when coming for trade and they
sent a canoe back for the stolen man. In the meantime, about seven
hundred Hurons descended to Montreal with thirteen Iroquois captives
made on the journey down. These were given to the Iroquois captain, who
remained as a hostage till the canoe returned, in the hope of making
peace. Soon the surgeon was brought back with a delegation, bearing
twenty necklaces of wampum as signs of peace from the Iroquois nation.

[Illustration: SANS MERCI

(By Hébert)]

One of the significant gifts was to recognize and consolidate the
position of Ville Marie as the headquarters of peace treaties, which
had been lately so constituted by the governor of Quebec, who had
transferred to Montreal the treaty pole which had been erected at
Quebec in the autumn of 1653 as a sign of peace. Its position at
Montreal signified the recognized place for parley councils for peace
overtures. This was an adroit move on the part of de Lauson. It
recognized that Montreal was the frontier post and the most accessible,
and also it was a standing eulogium of the diplomatic ability of de
Maisonneuve to deal with the natives, and it might keep the enemy
higher up the river away from Quebec.

Unfortunately, as we have said, these Iroquois were divided into five
nations, who often acted without concert, so that protestations of
peace by wampum belts had always to be taken for what they were worth.
Montreal was soon to be in daily dread of assault. Thus in the autumn,
when in fancied security, owing to the recent renewal of peace, the
ordinary precautions were being neglected at Montreal in the busy
building and farming operations, a band of Iroquois were in ambuscade
around. The sentinel was standing on a tree stump, leisurely surveying
the country around, when an Iroquois who had stealthily approached,
hiding at intervals behind other stumps, suddenly pounced upon him
and seizing him by the legs, threw him over his shoulders and set
off in flight with the bewildered soldier shrieking for his life and
fighting as best he could. His cries aroused the men in the field and
they pursued them until they came up to the Iroquois band with their
chief at their head. They would have fared badly had not Lambert Closse
come up with his men. Recognizing the chief, who was known by the
French as "La Barrique," or "The Hogshead," because of his barrel-like
corpulency, he ordered one of his best shots cautiously to get within
fighting distance, and pick him off.

Meanwhile Hogshead, unaware of impending disaster, was standing on
a stump haranguing his men and urging them to the attack, when he
received a charge of heavy lead full in his body and he fell to
the ground bathed in blood. Thinking him dead, his followers fled
incontinently.

But he did not die, for under the skillful care of the doctors and
Jeanne Mance, he was tended at the hospital and recovered, though he
was seriously crippled for the rest of his days. Their charity changed
his fierce disposition. When he left he promised never to go on the
warpath against them again but that he would return later to conclude a
peace, as indeed he did, though not so easily as he could have wished.

For a time the Iroquois left Montreal severely alone. "Let us not
go thither," they would say. "They are devils there." They turned
to attack the settlement of the Ile des Oies below Quebec instead.
But later, on May 31, 1655, they attacked the colony and killed one
Dabigeon.

Then they passed over to the other side of the St. Lawrence and
pretended to be another tribe, and sent delegates to parley with the
fort. Charles Le Moyne, who had just come from Quebec, recognized them
as the assailants at the Ile des Oies and, suspecting treachery, they
were told to come the next day. Finally, an engagement took place
and five Iroquois were taken prisoners to the camp, among them Chief
La Plume (or "The Feather"). Another parley now took place, and a
peace was agreed upon on the proposition of Chief La Grande Armée, on
condition that all the captives on both sides should be exchanged, and
that peace with the Hurons and Algonquins should be observed as long as
they should not advance above Three Rivers. Among the French restored
were the captives taken at Ile des Oies, one of whom, Elizabeth Moyen,
then a child, married Lambert Closse in 1657, and her sister Marie who
remained with Jeanne Mance twenty years.

Peace concluded, the work of agriculture was pushed on although, taught
by sad experience, the men went to the fields armed as usual. In order
to pursue this in greater safety, de Maisonneuve, by a permission given
on August 25, 1655, in the name of the Company allowed the colonists to
cultivate and enjoy the fruits of the lands on the "domain of the
Seigneurs," which were nearer to the fort than their own concessions.
When the time came for them to be able to till the latter, the lands
on the domain should be handed back. These negotiations were put into
the hands of Lambert Closse, for de Maisonneuve had chosen him to hold
the reins of government while he himself made a third journey to France
this autumn, as the next chapter will relate.

These peace arrangements at Montreal always meant the interchange
of presents which were a burden on the community instead of on the
governor of Quebec, whom the early historians, with M. de Belmont,
accuse of "persecuting Montreal."

In addition to what we know, de Lauson wanted to levy a tax on all
imports to Montreal. He took it ill that Montreal had its storehouse
at Quebec, wishing it to purchase its necessities from Quebec. He also
wanted the Company of Montreal to send out more men than they found
convenient. All this brought him a letter of Louis XIV in favour of
Montreal.

Misfortunes clouded the last days of de Lauson. He left for France
in the summer of 1656 and died in Paris on February 16, 1666, at the
age of eighty-two years. His sons, for whom he had planned great
possessions in Canada, did not live long after their father's departure
from Canada, and he saw nearly all his family extinct before his death
and all their properties reverting to the king on account of their
conditions of grant not being fulfilled. His ineffectual tenure of
office was due to his inefficiency, aggravated by the cruel abandonment
of the French colony by the great Company.

M. de Lauson was succeeded in the post of governor general by his
son, Charles de Lauson-Charny. But his administration was no more
successful than that of his father. Indeed the office was not to his
taste and he prevailed upon M. d'Ailleboust, who had arrived from
France on September 12, 1657, to take his place, and six days after he
sailed back home, disgusted with the vanities of the world, so that he
entered the ecclesiastical state, returning later to work in the sacred
ministry in Canada.

Meanwhile the new parish church, begun two years ago, was being
completed, the funds, owing to the poverty of the colonists, being
largely supplied by the Seigneurs. It was adjoined to the Hôtel-Dieu
on St. Paul Street, so that it might suffice for the citizens and the
sick. It was dedicated to St. Joseph, the patron of the hospital, and
was opened in 1656. In the foundation and under the doorway of entrance
there was placed, within the first stone, the following inscription,
engraven as a leaden plate: "Cette première pierre a été posée en
l'honneur de St. Joseph, l'an 1656, le 28 Août.

  Jesus! Maria! Joseph!"

This building, which served up to 1689 as the parish church of the
colony, was adjoined to the hospital situated on the street which was
formed a little afterwards by the first houses constructed at Ville
Marie and called St. Paul, and was placed at the corner of another
street which was called from the name of the church, St. Joseph, today
known as St. Sulpice. The body of the building was of wood, about
eighty feet long, thirty broad, and twenty feet high; the church being
at one end, covering about fifty feet, and surmounted by a bell tower
with two bells. The good folk of Ville Marie were proud to see their
new temple.

Affairs were now in a bad state; the Iroquois were uncurbed and
unsettled through the weak administration of de Lauson, and thus
prepared for the bitter war again to be proclaimed at the end of 1657.

But at present, in the summer of 1657, there was nothing but
anticipation of the arrival of the governor and the four Sulpicians
who were to be the parish clergy, with a permanent abode and a settled
ecclesiastical status.

The Jesuits who had so long served the mission were to be free to go to
the up-country Indians--their long connection with the settlement was
to be severed.


NOTE

THE JESUIT MISSIONARIES AT MONTREAL

(From 1642 to August 12, 1657, when the Sulpicians succeeded them.)

The first mayor of Montreal, Commander Jacques Viger, has collected
in a little manuscript book preserved in the Archives of St. Marie's
College at Montreal the list of Jesuits serving Montreal from 1642-1657
as follows:

Joseph Poncet, 1642-4; Joseph Imbert Duperon, 1642-3; Ambroise Daoust,
1643; Gabriel Druillettes, 1643-5; Isaac Jogues, 1645; Jacques Buteaux,
1645; Paul Le Jeune, 1645-6; Adrien Daran, 1646; Georges d'Eudemare,
1647-8; Jean de Quen, 1648-50; Pierre Bailloquet, 1648; Charles
Albanel, 1650; André Richard, 1650; Siméon Le Moyne, 1650; Claude
Pijart, 1650 to August 12, 1657.

Fifteen Jesuits resident in fifteen years. This does not account
for names of other distinguished missionaries visiting, whose names
appear on the registers as having officiated at Ville Marie baptisms,
marriages, deaths and other documents during this early period. Mr. E.
Z. Massicotte in his "Les Colons de Montreal de 1642-1667," gives some
of these as follows:

     1649--Jérome Lalemant, June 1st to 11th, May 19th to 24th.

     1650--Paul Ragueneau, two days.

     1655--Claude Dablon passed through Montreal in October, also on
     the 30th of March, 1666. He would also have signed 3-5-'62 a
     document concerning Hudson Bay.

     1656--Joseph Marie Chaumont, October, the bearer of a message for
     the Iroquois in 1661, was at Montreal in 1662, resided at Montreal
     in 1663.

     1656--Léonard Gareau, wounded in a combat on August 30th, buried
     September 2d.

     1657--François? le Mercier, July 24th.

Of the Montreal Jesuits, there are some who merit special mention here.


JOSEPH ANTOINE PONCET DE LA RIVIERE

Joseph Antoine Poncet de la Rivière, of aristocratic birth, was born
in Paris and entered the Society of Jesus in his nineteenth year as a
novice. His studies finished, he came to New France in 1639. He shortly
went to the Huron mission. We next find him, 1642-4, the first priest
in charge of the mission chapel at the fort of Montreal. After this he
ministered at Quebec. On his return from a visit to the Iroquois, he
went down the St. Lawrence and was the first white man to glide through
the Thousand Islands. He was giving the alarm to the colonists at
Cape Rouge in the summer of 1653, when he was himself seized by the
savages. He bore a remembrance of the ill treatment of his captivity
in the form of a lost finger, which a little child had been ordered
to cut off. He was afterwards released to the Dutch at Fort Orange
and returned to Quebec on November 5th, "just nine times nine days
after my capture," he says. We next know him as the storm centre of
ecclesiastical differences between Montreal and Quebec. As a result
of this Poncet was sent back to Europe. He was installed as French
penitentiary at Loretto, and later was sent to Martinique, where he
died on June 18, 1675.


ISAAC JOGUES

Isaac Jogues was born at Orléans, France, January 10, 1607. His first
schooling was at Rouen and he entered the Jesuit novitiate at Paris
in his seventeenth year. Having finished his studies and period of
teaching we find him in his twenty-ninth year reaching Canada in 1636
in the same vessel as Champlain's successor, Montmagny. Two or three
weeks later, that same October, Jogues began his missionary work,
joining a flotilla of Huron canoes and sailing 900 miles over dangerous
rivers and lakes, skirting rapids and precipices and making many
toilsome "portages" through dense forests, pools and marshes, to the
great Lake Huron which was known as "Fresh Water Sea."

[Illustration: JOGUES, THE JESUIT MISSIONARY]

Such was Jogues' first experience of missionary life. Living on Indian
corn and water, sleeping on rocks and in the woods, battling day after
day against a rapid current, dragging heavy burdens over the long
portages, a part of the time with a sick boy on his shoulder--till he
staggered through the triple stockade of the Indian town of Ihonitiria
and fell into the arms of de Brébeuf and his Jesuit companions. In this
new mission field one of the first works entrusted to his practical
sagacity, which stood his fellow missionaries in good stead, was the
construction of Fort Ste. Marie, whose ruins, discovered in 1859,
testify to the solidity of the outworks. His first apostolic work away
from Fort Ste. Marie was among the Petuns, or Tobacco Indians. In
September, 1641, he went with the Jesuit Raimbault to found a mission
among the Ojibways or Chippewas on the upper reaches of Lake Huron at a
place called by the missionaries Sault Ste. Marie, today a great centre
of commerce. They were the first white men to stand on the shores of
Lake Superior.

We next find him back at Georgian Bay. Supplies were being exhausted
and Jogues offered to go to Quebec, a thousand miles off, for them.
This done, on the way back in the first week of August, 1642, his party
was surprised by the hostile Mohawks and captured. While being taken
up country he was most brutally tortured, beaten by sticks, clubs and
knives, and his wounds torn open by the long nails of the Indians.
The joints of his fingers were gnawed off or burned off at intervals.
On the arrival of the party at Ossernenon, on the north bank of the
Mohawk, a captive Christian woman was compelled, under threat of death,
to saw off with a jagged shell the thumb of the priest. But he was not
killed, as so many of his party were.

On the 29th of September, 1642, René Goupil, his faithful companion,
was tomahawked in the skull for making the sign of the cross on the
head of a child. The place is identified as Auriesville.

When Goupil was dead, Jogues was alone and began his awful captivity
of more than a year, each moment of which was a martyrdom. In the
"Relation," which his superior commanded him to write, he has left us
a partial account of the horrors he endured. Employed in the filthiest
and most degrading of occupations he was regarded with greater contempt
than the most degraded squaw of the village. Heavy burdens were heaped
on his crippled and mangled shoulders, and he was made to tramp fifty,
sixty and sometimes a hundred miles after his savage masters, who
delighted to exhibit him wherever they went. His naked feet left bloody
tracks upon the ice or flints of the road; his flesh was rotting with
disease, and his wounds were gangrened; he was often beaten to the
earth by the fists or clubs of crazy and drunken Indians, and more than
once he saw the tomahawk above his head and heard his death sentence
pronounced. The wretched deerskin they persuaded him to wear was
swarming with vermin; he was often in a condition of semi-starvation
as he crouched in a corner of the filthy wigwam and saw the savages
gorging themselves with meat, which had been first offered to the
demons, and which he therefore refused to eat, though his savage
masters raged against the implied contempt to their gods. For thirteen
months he thus remained a captive. Yet he baptized more than seventy
persons, most of them Huron captives, at the point of death. Often
Jogues would rush into the flames up to the stake for this purpose.
During this time, on June 30, 1643, he secured a scrap of paper on
which he wrote to Montmagny that the Mohawks were about to make a raid
on Fort Richelieu. This message, carried for him by a Huron, warned
the garrison in time and the Indians were repulsed. This defeat was
traced to Jogues and his death was expected. But in the meantime an
order came from Governor Kieft of Manhattan to the commandant at
Fort Orange to secure his release at all costs. This required the
co-operation of Jogues. In spite of his harsh treatment the prisoner
was unwilling at first to enter into the plot, feeling it to be his
duty to remain at his post. At last he consented. He was conveyed to
the Dutch settlement of Fort Orange (Albany), which the angry Mohawks
threatened to burn, but fearful of risking a war with the Dutch while
they were fighting with the French, after a parley they consented to
relinquish their claim on the black robe for 300 _livres_. A six-day
journey brought him to Manhattan which he described as "seven leagues
in circuit and on it is a fort to serve as a commencement of a town to
be built there, and to be called New Amsterdam." At this town, as at
the place of his escape, he was kindly treated by the famous Dominic
Johannes Megapolensis, Jr., the first person who went to New York at
the invitation of Killaen van Rensselaer to look after the spiritual
affairs of the colony. After a month's sojourn at Manhattan, Father
Jogues left on November 5, 1643, in a wretched little vessel which,
after a severe tossing on the Atlantic, reached Falmouth, in Cornwall,
at the end of December, hotly pursued by some of Cromwell's ships, for
the rebellion against Charles I was then in progress.

[Illustration: NEW YORK AS SEEN BY LE MOYNE]

In Falmouth he was robbed, at the point of the pistol, of all his
belongings, by some marauders lurking round the port. At last, having
secured a free passage in a dirty collier, he was flung on Christmas
morning, 1643, on the coast of Brittany, but after eight days he
reached the Jesuit College at Rennes--and at last the emaciated,
haggard tramp was recognized as the lost Isaac Jogues, of whose capture
the "Relations" had warned them.

Honour was now meted out to this humble Jesuit much to his
discomfiture. Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV, called him to court
and compelled him to throw back his cloak and tell of the hideous
manner in which his fingers had been eaten or burned. The queen,
descending from the throne, took his hand in hers and, with tears
streaming down her cheeks, devoutly kissed the mutilated members and
exclaimed: "People write romances for us--but was ever a romance like
this? And it is all true."

This form of public exhibition was displeasing to Jogues but the
permission granted by Pope Urbain VIII, at the request of some of
his admirers, to have the canonical impediment raised against his
faculty to say mass because of his mutilated fingers, was a source of
gratification. The answer of Urbain to the request was "_Indignum esset
martyrum Christi, Christi non bibere sanguinem_"--"it would be wrong to
prevent the martyr of Christ from drinking the blood of Christ."

Isaac Jogues did not loiter to be lionized in Paris, but in June was
in Quebec, and was now appointed to serve the sick and hearten the
defenders of the stockade of Montreal. In July he was present at a
parley with the Indians at a conference held at Three Rivers, where
he met Father Bressani, who had also had a similar experience of the
tortures of the Iroquois and whose fingers were also wanting. After a
treaty had been made Jogues returned to Montreal. One result of this
treaty was that an ambassador was to be sent to the Mohawks and Father
Jogues, as he spoke the Iroquois tongue, was appointed to revisit
those who had so ill used him. But it was two years later before the
actual embassy started from Three Rivers, on May 16, 1646. Father
Jogues reached Lake Andiatarocté on the eve of Corpus Christi, the
feast of the Blessed Sacrament, and called it the "Lake of the Blessed
Sacrament." A century later this was renamed by Sir William Johnson
"Lake George" in honour of the English king. On June 5th Jogues reached
Ossernenon, and in his character as ambassador was well received. At
the council held on June 10th or June 16th the party returned, reaching
Quebec on July 3rd. Jogues petitioned to be sent back to the Mohawks
as a missionary. On September 27th he left Quebec for the Iroquois
country. He wrote to a friend: "Ibo sed non redibo--I go but I shall
not return," as though his fate were revealed to him.

[Illustration: LAKE OF THE BLESSED SACRAMENT]

Before he reached Ossernenon he learned that the hatchet had been
dug up to meet him. As an ambassador he had been respected, but as a
Christian missionary a hostile reception awaited him. An innocent box
of vestments left behind him on his previous visit was the cause. A
pestilence had broken out and the crops were withered. Therefore these
misfortunes were due to the _Manitou_ in the box. Jogues could have
avoided Ossernenon and returned to Quebec, but he faced his enemies,
who met him with the sorcerer, Ondersonk. Jogues wore his clerical
garb. His garments were stripped off him; he was slashed with knives
and led, mangled and bleeding, to the scene of his recent triumph as an
ambassador. A council was held at Tionnontoguen to see what was to be
done with him. The Wolf-Tortoise family were against killing him, as
were most of the Bears, and he was spared.

But the Bears, bent on vengeance, invited the wounded Jogues to a feast
on October 18th. He left his cabin and followed to the festive wigwam,
and as he entered a Mohawk, waiting behind the door brought down his
axe with a crash on to his skull. His head was hacked off and fixed on
a stake of the palisade, and his body was flung into the Mohawk River
hard by.

There is no reasonable doubt but that the place of his martyrdom
occurred at Auriesville on the south shore of the Mohawk just above
the Schoharie. "So died," says Ingram Kip, the Protestant bishop of
California, "one of that glorious band that had shown greater devotion
in the cause of Christianity than has ever been seen since the time
of the Apostles; men whose lives and sufferings reveal a story more
touching and pathetic than anything in the records of our country,
and whose names should ever be kept in grateful remembrance; stern,
high-wrought men who might have stood high in court or camp, and who
could contrast their desolate state in the lowly wigwam with the
refinement and affluence that waited on them in their earlier years,
but who had given up home and love of kindred and the golden ties of
relationship for God and man."

Another famous missionary who served Montreal and who often passed
through it on his journeys to and fro, was Siméon Le Moyne, who was
born about 1601. He entered the society at the age of nineteen and in
1638 he was at work in the Canadian mission field, chiefly among the
Hurons, among whom he was known as "Wane," or phonetically in English
"Won," the "w" taking the place of the missing "m" in their language,
the result being an attempt to reproduce the French pronunciation of
"Moyne." His early experiences at Lake Huron brought him in touch with
those other heroes, Brébeuf, Daniel, Lalemant, Jogues, and others, many
of whom were to be killed. He saw the annihilation of the Hurons and
wandered with the remnants over hill and dell and stream, ministering
to them. In 1654 he accepted the dangerous mission to the Iroquois at
Onondaga, leaving his life in the hands of the Almighty. His object
was to pacify the Iroquois as an ambassador, to give comfort to the
Huron captives and to prepare the way for a permanent mission. On
his return to Quebec he recommended this, and the Jesuits Dablon and
Chauminot were appointed. He held several councils and distributed
presents.[76] Le Moyne was endowed with a sense of humour. "Le Moyne,"
says the Rev. T. J. Campbell, "tells us that on this occasion he
strutted around like an actor, gesticulating extravagantly, imitating
the manners of their great orators, each time winning great grunts of
applause from the attendant chiefs and keeping up his eloquence for two
hours." The amusing part is that it was told in Huron, of which the
Iroquois had only a general knowledge: it was the parent stock. The
impressive manner he assumed--he was a past master in mimicry--no doubt
overwhelmed them and possibly whimpered interpretations were being
given at the same time to let them know what he was saying.

On his return, before reaching Montreal, we are told by Charlevoix that
Le Moyne was in a canoe with two Onondagas, the Hurons and Algonquins
following. As they approached Montreal they were surprised to find
themselves surrounded by several canoes full of Mohawks, who poured a
volley upon them from their muskets. The Hurons and Algonquins were all
killed, as well as one of the Onondagas. Le Moyne was taken and bound
as a prisoner of war, and the Onondaga was told to return home, but
he protested that he could not abandon the missionary, who had been
confided to him by the sachems of his canton and he menaced the Mohawks
with all the wrath of the Upper Iroquois. At first they laughed at his
threats, but when they saw that he would not flinch they unbound their
prisoner and put him in the hands of his faithful conductor, who led
him to Montreal. The chief, who was at the head of these Mohawks, was
known as the Flemish Bastard.

The Upper Iroquois, the Agnieronnons, those among whom Isaac Jogues had
been killed in 1646, jealous of the distinction paid to their kinsman,
the Onondagas, desired an envoy to be sent to them. Accordingly the
"Relation" of 1656 tells how Father Le Moyne left Montreal on August
17th with twelve Iroquois and a Frenchman. He arrived at the Village
of Agniée (Auriesville) on September 17th. He then visited Ossernenon
and later went on to Manhattan to visit the Dutch, after which he
returned to Ossernenon, leaving for Montreal in November, lucky to
escape with his life, having however promised the Mohawks to give them
missionaries. In the meantime the Onondagas had been already favoured
by missionaries, and a body of fifty Frenchmen, the nucleus of a
trading post. Again the jealousy of the Mohawks of Ossernenon caused a
second and a third visit from the diplomatic Le Moyne.

The trading post at Onondaga collapsed through the Frenchmen, hearing
of a plot to massacre them, decamping by night and making their way to
Montreal.

The perfidious Iroquois of Onondaga, angry at their discovered
treachery, were now joined by the Mohawks and for two years the St.
Lawrence witnessed bloody fights. Christian Huron settlements were
burned and pillaged, and white and red men massacred. Montreal was the
storm centre of war.

"One day in July (1661), when the storm was at its height, a number of
Iroquois canoes were seen coming down the river towards Montreal. The
garrison rushed to the stockade and watched them as they approached the
shore. In front was a flag of truce. The savage warriors, in paint and
feathers, stepped out as if assured of a friendly reception. The gate
was thrown open and, followed by four French captives, the Iroquois
advanced into the town. The spokesman was the redoubtable Cayuga chief,
named Saonchiowaga. Solemnly he broke the bonds of the French prisoners
and promised the liberation of others still in the Onondaga country.
Then he began his address, offering his presents meanwhile. Coming to
the fifth present he said: 'This is to bring the Frenchman back to us.
We still keep his mat; his house is still standing in Ganentoa. His
fire is still lighted, and his fields have been tilled and await his
return for his hand to gather the harvest.' Then, altering his tone
and raising aloft the last belt, he exclaimed: A black gown must come
to us; otherwise there will be no peace. On his coming depends the
lives of twenty Frenchmen at Onondaga.' And he placed in the governor's
hand a leaf of a book, on the margin of which the twenty unfortunate
captives had written their names." Campbell, Vol. I, p. 102.

Although many thought this a trick to lure others to death Father Le
Moyne offered to go to test its sincerity, and on July 21, 1661, he
left Montreal for Onondaga. There he was successful in concluding peace
with the help of Garagontié, "The Sun that Advances," who shortly went
down to Montreal to negotiate peace. But his withdrawal was a sorry
turn for Le Moyne, whom the Iroquois lads would have burned alive
on the scaffold at the stake. He escaped on one occasion with some
frightful scalds which took six months to heal. At another time he
was nearly tomahawked. The return of Garagontié alone made his work
of charity among the Onondagas possible. He had plenty to do to look
after the French captives and to secure their ransom. In this he was
largely successful and returned to Montreal in the summer of 1662. The
"Relations" record this as follows: "On the last day of August, 1662,
the father made his appearance in a canoe below the Falls of St. Louis,
having around him all the happy rescued ones and a score of Onondagas,
who from being enemies, had become their boatmen. They landed amid the
cheers and embraces of all the French of Montreal, and following Father
Le Moyne proceeded to the church to thank God."

Wars prevented him going back to Onondaga, but he applied for the post
in 1664. His shattered health, however, stood in the way, and he died
in 1665, sick of a fever at Cape Madeleine, opposite Three Rivers. He
may be called the Apostle of the Onondagas.


JAMES BUTEAUX

James Buteaux was born at Abbeville, in France, on April 11, 1600, and
joined the Canadian mission shortly after it was handed over to the
French. He served the Algonquin missions and while at Montreal not
only did he accompany the Christian Indians in their fights, but he
heartened the little garrison at home, as also the good Maisonneuve,
who was then realizing what his declaration had meant when he had
told Montmagny that he would stay in Montreal if every tree were an
Iroquois. He was a most devoted missionary, although he was a frail
man. "I have often seen him," says Father de Quen, "tramping in the
dark through three or four feet of snow, groping along by the light
of a lantern which the howling wind would often tear from his hand or
extinguish, while he himself would perhaps be flung by the violence of
the storm down some icy trail into the snowdrifts below. This would be
surprising news," continues the writer, "for those who remember him in
France, frail to the last degree and almost always a valetudinarian."
This happened at Sillery and his devotedness, no doubt, was similar at
Montreal.

His whole life was led midst the alarms of war. On the 10th of May,
1652, when, with a Huron and a Frenchman, on a journey from his beloved
Three Rivers on a mission to the White Fish tribe, he was fallen upon
by Iroquois. The Huron was seized and the priest and Frenchman fell
riddled with bullets. The savages then rushed upon them with their
knives and tomahawks, stripped them naked and flung them into the river.


GABRIEL DRUILLETTES

Gabriel Druillettes, it is said, was born in 1593, but it is certain he
came to Canada on August 15, 1643, in the same ship with the Jesuits
Garreau and Chabanel, both subsequently being slain by the Indians. He
served Montreal for a short time, but his after-career as the "Apostle
of Maine" entitles him to considerable fame in early American history.
In 1670 he went to the West. In 1671 the white-haired missionary was
at the solemn "_prise de possession_" at Sault Ste. Marie, ordered by
Talon. He remained at the Sault till 1679, whence he journeyed to
Quebec to rest after his long missionary wanderings, dying two years
later, full of years and good works.


CHARLES ALBANEL

Charles Albanel was born in 1613 and came to America on August 23,
1649, and in the following year was at Montreal. His after-career was
one of adventure. He may be called the missionary of the Hudson Bay.
In his second visit there in 1674 he went expressly as Frontenac's
secret agent to induce Radisson to abandon the service of the Hudson's
Bay Company; in fact he handed Radisson a letter from Colbert offering
him a position in the French navy, the payment of all his debts and a
gratuity of 400 pounds sterling if he would return to his allegiance.
The adventurer eventually accepted the proposition. Charles Albanel
was taken prisoner to England because he did endeavour to convert "ye
Indians and persuade them not to trade with ye English."

He is described as a "little ould man born of English parentage." He
was set free, and was in France in 1675, on July 22d set sail for
America. Coming back from Canada his superiors kept him away from the
Hudson Bay territory and sent him west, and the "little ould man" of
1674 died twenty-two years later, as a missionary at Sault Ste. Marie
on January 11, 1696.


PAUL LE JEUNE

Paul Le Jeune, whom the distinguished historian of New York, Dr.
O'Callaghan, calls the Father of the Canadian missions, one among
many reasons for this title being, that, when Canada was restored to
the French, he was elected as superior of the missions, was born at
Châlons-sur-Marne in July, 1591, and arrived in Canada in 1632.[77]
He was the friend of Champlain, whose funeral oration he pronounced
in 1635. He was highly esteemed by Montmagny. As superior of the
missions he ruled from Miscou to Lake Huron, but he was glad enough
to serve humbly in the ranks when Father Vimont became provincial.
Thus it is that we find him serving the mission of Montreal. In 1649
he returned to France as procurator of the French missions in Canada.
Later on when there was a question of naming a bishop of Quebec, Father
Le Jeune was the choice of the queen regent. Charles Lalemant and
Ragueneau were also mentioned, but the general of the Jesuits forbade
the consideration of any Jesuit for that post. Laval, as we know, was
eventually appointed. In 1661, it was Le Jeune who made the touching
and fearless appeal to Louis XIV himself for the perishing colony. This
helped to open the eyes of the monarch and was the herald of better
times which, however, did not occur till 1666, two years after the
death of Le Jeune, when de Tracy's and de Courcelles' handful of men
brought the peace which lasted for fifteen years.

It would be tedious to the reader to give further autobiographical
notes. Yet the importance of these Montreal missionaries for the
colonization of New France and the civilization of the Indians
justifies the space we have allotted.

Parkman in his "Jesuits," pages 318-320, sums up the success of their
missions thus:

"When we look for the results of those missions we soon become aware
that the influence of the French and the Jesuits extended far beyond
the circle of converts. It eventually modified and softened the manners
of many unconverted tribes.

"In the wars of the next century we do not find those examples of
diabolical atrocity with which the earlier annals are crowded. The
savage burned his enemies alive, it is true, but he rarely ate them;
neither did he torment them with the same deliberation and persistency.
He was a savage still, but not so often a devil. * * * In this
softening of manner, such as it was, and in the obedient Catholicity of
a few hundred tamed savages gathered at stationary missions in Canada,
we find after a century had elapsed all the results of the heroic toil
of the Jesuits. The missions had failed because the Indians had ceased
to exist. Of the great tribes on whom rested the hopes of the early
Canadian fathers, nearly all were virtually extinct. The missionaries
built laboriously and well, but they were doomed to build on a falling
foundation. The Indians melted away, not because civilization destroyed
them, but because their own ferocity and untractable indolence made it
impossible that they should exist in its presence. Either the plastic
energies of a higher race, or the servile pliancy of a lower one, would
each in its way have preserved them; as it was, their extinction was
a foregone conclusion. As for the religion which the Jesuits taught
them, however Protestants may carp at it, it was the only form of
Christianity likely to take root in their crude and barbarous nature."

The following appreciation of the early Jesuits, taken from "The
Dominion of Canada--The Brave Days of Old," by a Protestant writer,
Professor Grant, of Kingston, may be of interest as coming from a later
day pen:

"Eyes and heart alternately glow and fill as we read the endless
'Relations' of their faith and failures, their heaped-up measure of
miseries, their boundless wisdom, their heroic martyrdoms. We forget
our traditional antipathy to the name of Jesuit. The satire of Pascal,
the memories of the Inquisition and the political history of the
order, is all forgotten. We dislike to have our sympathies checked
by reminders, that in Canada as elsewhere, they were the consistent,
formidable foes of liberty; that their love of power not only embroiled
them continually with the civil authorities, but made them jealous
of the Recollects and Sulpicians, unwilling that any save their own
order--or, as we say, sect--should share in the dangers and glory of
converting the infidels of New France. How can we, sitting at home in
ease, we who have entered into their labours, criticize men before
whose spiritual white heat every mountain melted away; who carried the
cross in advance of the most adventurous 'coureurs de bois,' or guides,
who taught agriculture to the Indian on the Georgian Bay before a dozen
farms had been cleared on the St. Lawrence--drove or carried cattle
through unbroken forest around the countless rapids and cataracts of
the Ottawa and French rivers that they might wean the Hurons from
nomadic habits and make of them a nation; who shrank from no hardship
and no indignity if by any means they might save some of the miserable
savages who heaped indignities upon themselves; who instituted
hospitals and convents wherever they went, always (in the spirit of
their masters) caring most for the weak, the decrepit, the aged;
and submitted themselves, without thinking of escape, to inutterable
tortures rather than lose an opportunity of administering the last
sacraments to those who had fallen under the hatchets of the Iroquois!
Few Protestants have any idea of the extraordinary missionary activity
of the Church of Rome in the seventeenth century. Few Englishmen know
to what extent French society was inspired then by religious fervour.
Few Canadians have any knowledge of the spiritual inheritance of which
they are the heirs. It would be well for all of us to read Parkman's
'Jesuits in North America,' if we cannot get hold of the original
'Relations;' for the story, looked at even from a Protestant and
republican standpoint, is one to do us all good, revealing as it does
the spiritual bonds that link into oneness of faith Protestant and
Roman Catholic, and teaching that beneath the long black robe of the
dreaded Jesuit is to be found, not so much that disingenuousness and
those schemes of worldly ambition usually associated with the name, but
a passionate devotion to the Saviour, love for the souls of men and the
fixed steadfastness of the martyr's spirit that remains unshaken when
heart and flesh faint and fail.

"The prophetic words of the father superior of the Jesuits in 1647 stir
the heart of the Christian--by whatsoever name known among men--like
the blasts of a trumpet: 'We shall die; we shall be captured, burned,
butchered. Be it so. Those who die in their beds do not always die
the best death. I see none of our Company cast down.' And truly, in
spite of failures, these men did a great work. Seeds of divine truth
they sowed broadcast over the wilderness. Gradually they tempered
the ferocity of the Indian character, and mitigated the horrors of
Indian war. They induced the remnants of many tribes to settle under
the shadow of their missions protected by forts. Portions even of the
terrible Iroquois settled in Canada and the church has, on the whole,
no children more obedient, and Queen Victoria certainly no subjects
more loyal."--(Scribner's Magazine, quoted in Canadian Antiquarian and
Numismatic Journal, 1879.)

In the autumn of 1655, profiting by the peace concluded, and seeing the
progress of the town well under way, the governor left Montreal under
the charge of Lambert Closse, and sailed for France. His object was
threefold (1) to promote the erection of an episcopal seat in Canada;
(2) to secure, as originally arranged, permanent parish priests for
Montreal from M. Olier's Seminary of St. Sulpice, since the Jesuits,
being missionaries, desired their men to be ready to visit the
far-off tribes; and (3) to bring back the sisters of the Institute of
Hospitalières, erected lately by M. de la Dauversière, in view of the
service of the Hôtel-Dieu.

On arriving in France, an agreement was entered into by which three or
four of the Hospitalières of La Flèche should come to Montreal when all
was ready. M. Olier, who had wished to finish his days in Canada, chose
for Maisonneuve three of his priests, Gabriel de Queylus, whom he named
superior; Gabriel Souart, Dominic Galinier, and a deacon, M. d'Allet.

In the choice of M. Gabriel de Thubières de Lévy Queylus as superior,
the Associates saw their likely nominee as the bishop whom they wished
to have in the see of New France. They had him in view in promoting
the creation of the episcopal see before the assembly of the bishops
on August 9, 1656, through the good services of Mgr. Godeau, Bishop
of Vence. This was again brought up before the assembly on January
10, 1657, and Cardinal Mazarin, then present, undertook to interest
the king in the formation of the episcopal see as desired. On this
occasion the name of the Abbé de Queylus was mentioned to Cardinal
Mazarin by the bishop of Vence as a man of approved "probity, capacity
and zeal, who possesses an abbacy of considerable value. He is willing
to sacrifice himself in this new episcopate, in a barbarous country,
so far from all consolation; and his person is agreeable to the Jesuit
fathers." (Procès Verbal of the General Assembly, January 10, 1657.)

M. de Queylus had many and great qualifications. He was a doctor of
theology. His capacity and zeal had been shown as the superior of the
community of the parish of St. Sulpice at Paris, when he was Olier's
right hand man. He had laboured in the ecclesiastical reform of several
dioceses in Languedoc and had established the diocesan Seminary of
Viviers, which he sustained by his liberality. He enjoyed the abbacy of
Loc Dieu. He had a private income--a valuable thing for a bishop in a
poor diocese; and his choice, it was alleged, was likely to please the
Jesuits.

This latter was an important argument, for this Order had been on the
ground so long, that they were the most fitted to understand the needs
of a missionary country, and of the natives whose languages they spoke.
They were zealous, able men, who had become necessary, and their blood
had been freely spent in the work of colonization and Christianity. It
would have been most appropriate to have chosen a bishop from among
them, except that the democratic spirit of the order is against the
acceptance of dignities, unless forced upon them. Seeing this, it was
etiquette and the wisdom of the Church not to impose an ecclesiastical
superior above them, without consulting their wishes.

But there is no proof of the above assertion that the Jesuits approved
of de Queylus; indeed, on the contrary, as soon as they learned of
his nomination in the same month of January, they proposed the Abbé
François de Laval de Montmorency, to the king, as their candidate for
the projected see of New France. This opposition shelved the immediate
question of the appointment of a bishop, which was delayed till the
consecration of Laval on December 8, 1658.

Meanwhile M. Olier thought that there should be no delay in the
Sulpicians taking up the pastoral work of Montreal. Accordingly we find
M. de Queylus and his three companions at Nantes waiting to embark,
when the sad news came that M. Olier had died at Paris on Easter
Monday, April 2, 1657.

This was a great blow, since M. Olier was looked upon as the soul of
the Montreal mission. The departure was postponed till the middle of
May. In the meantime the missionaries had recourse to the Archbishop
of Rouen with whom, by prescription, the jurisdiction of New France
lay, seeing that it had not been revoked by the Holy See in 1643. From
him they received by letters dated April 22, 1657, all the accustomed
powers granted on such occasions to Canadian missionaries. But the Abbé
de Queylus received, in addition a "proprio motu" from the archbishop,
appointing him his "grand vicar for all New France." This was a
false step on the part of the Archbishop of Rouen and M. de Queylus,
for it put, even the superior of the Jesuit missionaries under the
local superior of Montreal, a most unwise proceeding. Secondly, the
archbishop forgot that already the Jesuit superior had been granted
similar powers and he had not revoked them. He should certainly have
foreseen inevitable friction. To Rouen is to be attributed the long
drawn out battle now to commence between Quebec and Montreal.

On May 17, 1657, the four missionaries set sail with M. de Maisonneuve,
M. and Mme. d'Ailleboust and other passengers.

On reaching the Isle of Orleans, two leagues from Quebec, Maisonneuve
and the Montreal party disembarked, desirous to proceed immediately by
another vessel to Montreal. But M. d'Ailleboust, arriving at Quebec on
July 29th, announced the coming of the Sulpicians, so that kind-hearted
Père de Quen, formerly in charge of Montreal and now superior of the
Jesuit missions, immediately set forth for the Ile d'Orleans to call
upon them. He congratulated Queylus on his letters of vicar general,
and induced him to come to Quebec. It is strange that de Queylus, with
the letters he bore, did not call directly upon the Jesuit superior
whom he was to supplant. There is no doubt that the position of the
Abbé Queylus was not understood by the Jesuits. Faillon, in his history
of "La Colonie Française," says quite wrongly that there was an express
clause, in the authorization of the new grand vicar, now disclosed to
Father de Quen, especially mentioning the immediate cession of those
powers already granted to the Jesuit superior of the missionaries. M.
de Queylus, no doubt in good faith read this into his letters but he
weakly explained that he would confine the exercise of his powers to
Montreal. The letter of the archbishop certainly did not specifically
revoke previous powers given to the Jesuits. Father de Quen as a
canonist pointed out that it was more consistent that the Abbé de
Queylus, in doubt as to the revocation of the Jesuits' powers, should
follow out the full powers of universal jurisdiction claimed by him.
On this the grand vicar, who did not need much pressure, made with the
assent of Père de Quen an official visit of the parish church which
was under the charge of Father Poncet, the first Jesuit missionary at
Montreal in 1642. Father de Quen's action was weak, but wise, as he
thought, at this time. M. de Queylus confirmed the friendly Father
Poncet in the government of the parish of Quebec and handed to him
the bull of indulgence of Pope Alexander VII on the occasion of his
exaltation to the pontificate.

Father de Quen explained his temporizing acquiescence in a manuscript
letter, in Latin to the general of the society, of September 3, 1658.
"It is true that I did not wish to exercise any act [of jurisdiction,
as a vicar general] from that day on which M. l'Abbé Queylus laid his
letters patent of authority before me lest any evil should thence
arrive; however, I could not, nor would not, yield my jurisdiction
(potestatus et res) until I became certain that it had been revoked
by his Eminence the Archbishop of Rouen, who had granted it to me."
Thus the Jesuit acted constitutionally and wisely. Rouen would now be
approached by him.

In the meantime, after having been recognized as "grand vicaire" M.
de Queylus with the Sulpicians proceeded to Ville Marie. On August
12th Père Claude Pijart, the missionary, gave over the exercise of
his ministry to M. Gabriel Souart who now became the _curé_ or parish
priest. Father Pijart remained in Montreal for some time, but, on
September 3rd, he was in Quebec, where he was appointed to take the
place of Père Poncet, in the charge of the parish church. Père
Poncet, though a zealous and enterprising man, had shown himself a
difficult subject, and his obedience and his spirit of independence had
been already called in question in a letter to Rome. As this may be
accounted the beginning of the ecclesiastical trouble between Montreal
and Quebec we will follow Père Pijart.

On arriving at Quebec, Père Pijart found that the injudicious Père
Poncet had been deposed from his office by his superior, Père de
Quen, as a consequence of his promulgation of the bull left behind
by the grand vicar, announcing the opening of the jubilee for August
12th. Père de Quen, now no longer acting as grand vicar, but still
the superior of the Jesuit missions of Canada, had apparently been
ignorant of the arrival of this bull, and he considered that as his
religious superior and that of most of the clergy in the country he
should have had notification of it and he deposed the parish priest,
Père Poncet,--a power which he had arranged with M. de Queylus to
retain as a religious superior according to acknowledged ecclesiastical
etiquette. The position was a new one. Time only could straighten out
the inevitable difficulties arising in a double régime now commencing.
Père Poncet meanwhile, appointed to the Indian mission of Onondaga
started the year previously, left Quebec on August 28th and, passing by
Montreal, informed the "grand vicaire" of the loss of his parish. The
latter impetuously prevailed on him to suspend his journey, forgetful
that in his inexperience he was committing a new breach of church
etiquette in interfering with the orders of the Jesuit superior to
his own subject, and together they arrived, with M. d'Ailleboust and
the deacon, M. d'Allet, acting as Queylus' secretary, at Quebec on
September 12th.

On September 18th, Father Poncet was sent by de Quen back to France, a
sad return for an heroic man but obedience for the Jesuit is the formal
test of heroism.

M. d'Ailleboust was now called upon to act as governor general,
replacing M. de Lauson-Charny _ad interim_, till another was formally
appointed. On arriving M. Queylus, superseding Father Pijart, unwisely
and ambitiously took up the functions of parish priest himself in
the hitherto Jesuit church and remained there for a year. This was
open hostility. He was assisted on occasions by the chaplain of
the Ursulines, M. Guillaume Vignal, and that of the Hôtel-Dieu, M.
Jean Lebey, both secular priests. M. Queylus lived at the château
with the governor general while the Jesuits inhabited the official
presbytery. The position was electrical and there was open hostility.
There were two factions. Occasional interchange of courtesies and
ministry were, however, carried on and a semblance of diplomatic peace
at last arrived at, so that d'Argenson, the new governor general,
writing on September 5, 1658, a year later, says: "I was surprised,
after having heard in France of the little differences between the
reverend Jesuits and M. l'Abbé de Queylus, to see the union between
them and the church entirely at peace." He recommended, however, the
appointment of a bishop as a solution of the difficulty. D'Argenson had
arrived unexpectedly at Quebec on July 11th. He brought over powers to
settle the ecclesiastical "impasse." During the year the Jesuits had
communicated with the archbishop of Rouen, Mgr. de Harlay, and a brief
of March 30, 1656, written in French, arranged that there should be
two "grands vicaires," one for the Quebec district in the person of
the superior of the Jesuits, and M. de Queylus, who should exercise
his jurisdiction in that of Montreal only. This was not communicated
to M. de Queylus till August 8th. He was at first inclined to dispute
the situation, but d'Argenson, assuring him of the cognizance of
the Company of Montreal of this matter, he "peacefully" acquiesced,
departing from Quebec on August 21st with M. and Mme. d'Ailleboust,
whose presence was no longer required there. During his stay in Quebec
M. Queylus founded the church of Ste. Anne de Beaupré, since, the great
Canadian shrine, the scene of many pilgrimages, and in many ways showed
himself a progressive administrator. He was certainly an active man,
with the defects of his qualities.

The explanation of the letter brought by d'Argenson is as follows:
Shortly after the surprise received by the appearance of the Sulpician
vicar general the superior of the Jesuits, Père de Quen wrote to Father
Brisacier, the Jesuit rector of the college at Rouen, to ask him to
enquire of his Grace the Archbishop of Rouen if he had withdrawn his
faculties as vicar general or not.

He also wrote at the same time to the general of the order, Goswin
Nickel, acquainting him of the new situation in Canada. On December
17, 1657, the general himself also wrote to Father Brisacier in Latin
as follows: "Father J. de Quen, superior of the Canadian missions, has
written to me on September 20th of this year, that he and his subjects
are being harassed by the Abbé de Queylus, sent out there last summer
by his Eminence the Archbishop of Rouen, to act as his vicar general,
asserting that the marriages celebrated by fathers acting as parish
priests are null; that they are abusing the power and jurisdiction of
the vicar general which they had obtained; that he could dispose of
our men 'ad libitum,' and other things which have no little disturbed
the nascent church. The evil might increase from day to day unless
his Grace the Archbishop, through his zeal and piety, will early look
into the matter. Your Reverence will see whether you can obtain from
him either that the power of this abbé may be revoked or that he shall
so treat with ours that he shall have come to New France not for its
destruction but for its upbuilding." (Arch. Gen., 89.)

The final response to the difficulty came to Quebec on July 11, 1658,
when the letter of Mgr. de Harlay, the archbishop of Rouen, arrived.

"To put an end to the differences," he says, "which have intervened
between the Sieur Abbé de Queylus and the venerable superior of the
Jesuits of the house of Quebec, both our _grands vicaires_ in the
part of our diocese called La Nouvelle France, until it may be more
amply provided for by your authority, we have ordered that Sieur Abbé
de Queylus shall exercise hereafter and from the day of the present
ordinance, the vicariate which we have given him, according to the
powers we have given him, in the extent of the Island of Montreal; as
also the superior of the Jesuits of the house of Quebec shall exercise
_the same powers_ that we have accorded him, without either one or
the other of the two grands vicaires being able to undertake anything
in their different territories without the consent of the one and the
other." This act was made and signed at Paris on March 30, 1658.

It would certainly appear then that Father de Quen's powers had never
been revoked, that Abbé de Queylus had forced the sense of his letters
patent accorded April 22, 1657, since in giving him an extended
jurisdiction he did not revoke previous powers given. There were to be
two independent parallel vicariates under Rouen. In a later letter of
September 3, 1658, of Father de Quen to the general of his order, he
interprets the above as a _confirmation_ of his previous powers, and
not a _new concession_.

"The Most Eminent Archbishop of Rouen has sent me letters in which he
_confirms_ the power conceded by him to us _now since many years_, of
vicar general of Quebec and in other adjacent places. He has written
also to the Abbé de Queylus a letter which has constituted him vicar
general in the Island of Montreal only." (Arch. Gen., S. J.)

In spite of the storm clouds gathered over them, the arrival of the
Sulpicians at Montreal was welcomed. They represented to the colonists,
the Company of Notre-Dame de Montreal that had brought them out. M. de
Queylus was wealthy and a member of the Company of Montreal, and the
others were self supporting members of a body, to whom it had already
been proposed by the Company to hand over the seigneury of the whole
island, as indeed happened in 1663. This meant material advancement
for the church and progress for the settlement. Although the Jesuits
were very much loved by the people, their number was small, they had
no settled income and frequently they were called to absent themselves
from Montreal. The permanent presence of four Sulpicians, with the
prospects of an assured continuity, was indeed gratifying also from a
spiritual point of view. The honour of receiving them fell to Jeanne
Mance, and they were allotted the large room in the hospital, which
was at once the refectory, recreation, study, and bedroom, all in one.
There they remained till the stone house named the Seminary was built
for them. M. Souart being a doctor could also be on hand for assistance
to the hospital sick.

Meanwhile, the peaceful situation at Ville Marie, during the above
negotiations, claims our attention.

The advent of the Sulpicians marks the growth of organized progress in
the development of the religious and civic life of Montreal. It was due
to them that the church began to take on parish proportions, one of
their first acts being the foundation of the "Oeuvre de Fabrique" soon
to be chronicled. It was the mission of the Jesuits to be the hardy
pioneers to succour the spiritual needs during their early days of the
handful of struggling settlers; that of the Sulpicians to develop the
sense of civic administration and to guide it for many generations. A
modern historian[78] writing in 1887, pays the following tribute to the
Sulpicians:

"Thus not only the city but the entire Island of Montreal today
possesses an ecclestiastico-civil status, that is now denied even to
Rome. This circumstance must never be overlooked, for it has been
far-reaching in its influence. Montreal's first lessons in Christian
civilization were taken under the auspices I have just described--among
the best, it may safely be said, that the France of the period
could furnish--and every Protestant church, as well as every other
institution in the city, has felt the powerful sway of the gentlemen of
the Seminary."

The position of the Catholic Church in the city with its many beautiful
churches and educational establishments stands largely as a monument to
the important seeds sown in this coming in 1657.

M. de Queylus did not stay long in Ville Marie, for on September 3rd he
started for Quebec, as said, to assume the control of the parish church.

On October 25, 1857, the Sulpicians were to experience their first
taste of war, for they had three burials in one day in the same
sepulchre. On this day, Nicholas Godé was building his house at Point
St. Charles, assisted by his son-in-law, Jean Saint Père, the notary,
and Jacques Noël, their hired assistant, when several of a band of
Indians who had been in the neighbourhood, approached the house and
were hospitably treated. After a meal the three had gone unarmed on
the roof, which they were covering, when their guests treacherously
fired at them, and their hosts came toppling off the roof like wounded
sparrows. Nicholas Godé and Jacques Noël they scalped, but cutting the
head off Jean Saint Père, they fled with it, to exhibit his handsome
headpiece to their braves.

Dollier de Casson, who arrived in Montreal later, says that he heard
the following story from the lips of trustworthy persons, among them a
man, whom Marguerite Bourgeoys in her _memoirs_ names a M. Cuillérier,
who having been a prisoner among the Iroquois spoke their language, and
had heard the story from the savages themselves, that the head of Jean
Saint Père proved a trouble to them, for he reproached them in very
good Iroquois in such words as these: "You kill us, and you do many
cruel things to us; you wish to wipe out the French in this country.
You will not come to your wish. You will have to take care, for one day
we shall be your masters and you will obey us." And this, although the
deceased knew no word of Iroquois; wherever they were, day and night,
they heard the voice; in their vexation they scalped the head and threw
the troublesome skull away, but they still heard the accusing voice.
Dollier de Casson believed the story and thought he must not pass it
over in obscurity. A modern historian would explain that the frightened
Indians only heard subjectively the voice of their accusing conscience.

Not ignoring this sign of the approaching outbreak of hostilities,
d'Ailleboust, at Quebec, gave instructions, on November 1st, that all
Iroquois approaching the forts should be seized, looking upon the late
act as a declaration of war.

Two Iroquois had been seized by de Maisonneuve, one of them an
Onondagan, but not wishing by these arrests to compromise the Jesuits
at the mission at Onondaga he sent this Indian with three letters
addressed to them, asking them to explain the massacre at Point St.
Charles and telling them that the prisoners were being retained in
honourable custody, until it was learned whether the late attack had
been made by their people or not.

Amid such anxious times the new church, begun in 1656, was rapidly
nearing completion, assisted by the funds provided by the Sulpicians.
It was a modest building of wood and stood on the corner of St. Joseph
(St. Sulpice Street of today) and St. Paul. There it stood till 1678,
the first "parish" church, till it was given over entirely to the
hospital for the sick.

The church at Montreal now took on parochial airs and pretentions
although it was not canonically erected as a parish till 1678, and it
must have its _marguilliers_, or church wardens. Accordingly at an
election held November 21, 1657, Louis Prud'homme, Jean Gervaise and
Gilbert Barbier were appointed. This day must be taken as the birthday
of the foundation of the parish of Montreal. The parish or at least
the establishment of the "Fabrique" or corporation for the management
of the temporals of the church school was next to be set up. A stable
in stone, 36 by 18 feet, situated near the hospital, with a plot of
playing ground of forty-eight perches, was donated by the Company
through Maisonneuve by act of January 22, 1658. "The present concession
made to be of service for the instruction of the girls of Montreal
as well as for the dwelling for the said Marguerite Bourgeoys, and
after her decease, to perpetuity," this latter being inserted because
it was understood that Marguerite would found a body to continue the
work after her. She was then thirty-eight years of age. The donation
was accepted and witnessed by the chief officers of the community: M.
Souart, _curé_; M. Galinier, _vicaire_; the then church wardens; Marin
Jannot, syndic; Lambert Closse, "major of the island," Mademoiselle
Mance, administratrice of the hospital, and Charles Le Moyne,
storekeeper of the Company.

Montreal of today is perhaps the greatest educational centre on this
continent. It receives its students from all parts. Let us then glance
at the description given by Marguerite Bourgeoys, in her memoirs, of
the humble beginnings of the first home of education in Montreal: "Four
years after my arrival M. de Maisonneuve was good enough to give me
a stone stable to make a school of it and to lodge there persons to
conduct it. This stable has served as a dovecot and a home for cattle.
It had a granary loft above to sleep in, to which it was necessary to
ascend by an outside staircase. I had it cleaned and a chimney put
in, and all that was necessary for schoolkeeping." School was opened
on April 30. She was assisted by Marguerite Picard who on November 5
married Nicholas Godé and afterwards became Madame Lamontagne, Sieur
de la Montague, son of Nicholas, the joiner, who came in 1642. The
girls too old to go to school Marguerite formed, on July 2, 1658, into
a pious girls' club, or sodality, on the lines of the Congregation of
Externes at Troyes, of which she herself had been a member. Thus the
house became known as the "Congregation."

The next date of interest this year (1658) is that of April 3rd,
"when," says Dollier de Casson, "fifty Frenchmen reached here under
the command of M. Dupuis, with the Jesuit fathers who had been forced
to leave the mission of Onondaga for fear of being burned alive by the
Iroquois. Several of their people, less disposed than they to death by
being burned alive, as well as to any other kind which Providence might
please to send, had such a fright that they were only cured when they
came in sight of Montreal, a like miracle occurring here several times."

This is the sequel of the letters sent by Maisonneuve, and its
story must be told. The letters were not delivered, but instead the
treacherous Indian messenger told the Onondagas that the French had
just allied themselves with the Algonquins to make war against them.
This angering the Onondagans, they concerted with the Mohawks and a
delegation went to Quebec, arriving on January 3, 1658, to demand
the return of their twelve prisoners detained as hostages. But M.
d'Ailleboust gave them little satisfaction and they departed in
February.

In the same month a secret gathering was held, at Agnié of a few of
the most influential heads of all the Iroquois nations, and there was
sworn a war of extermination of the whites if their captives were not
returned, and they would commence with the settlement of the black
robes at Onondaga, which had been settled with them at their own
invitation in 1656. A Christian Iroquois revealed this plot to the
missionaries at Onondaga and these communicated it to Quebec. But how
to escape from their own impending slaughter, the like of which had
been witnessed on August 3, 1657, when seven Christians had been slain,
by these same Onondagas before the horrified eyes of Father Ragueneau,
then on his way, to be similarly repeated when, on reaching Onondaga,
some of the Christian captives were burned, including several women and
their infant children.

As Father Ragueneau was among the fugitives that came to Montreal with
Zacharie Dupuis, we may take his story as substantially that which the
terrified party told to the horror-stricken Montrealers but with more
harrowing details. But first a note on the relater. Paul Ragueneau,
born in Paris in 1605, came to Canada when he was thirty-one years of
age. In 1646 he was superior of the Huron missions. He was an ideal
superior and was very much valued by de Lauson and d'Avaugour on the
supreme council. He left Canada in 1662 and acted as the procurator
for the Canadian missions in Paris. He died in 1680, on September 3.
A year after Father Dablon had sailed with his fifty Frenchmen over
Lake Onondaga he was followed by Paul Ragueneau in August, 1657, with a
band of thirteen or sixteen Senecas, thirty Onondagas and about fifty
Christian Hurons. On the way there was a general butchery of the Hurons
by the rest of the party which Ragueneau was forced to witness. When he
reached Onondaga his practiced eye took in the unsettled situation. The
lives of the French colonists were treacherously foresworn to Indian
butchery. This plot became clearer as the autumn passed. In the early
months of 1658, Ragueneau, who was superior, called in gradually the
missionaries from the outstations and it was arranged with Dupuis, the
French commandant, to make a secret flight on the night of March 21,
1658.

Ragueneau's official account of this, to be found in the "Relations"
of this year, is as follows: "The resolution was taken to quit the
country forthwith, even though the difficulties seemed unsurmountable.
To supply the want of canoes we built, in secret, two boats of a novel
structure to pass the rapids. They were flat-bottomed and could carry
considerable freight, with fourteen or fifteen men on each. We had,
besides, four Algonquin and four Iroquois canoes. The difficulty was to
build and launch them without being detected, for without secrecy we
could only expect a general massacre.

"After succeeding in finishing the boats we invited the savages in our
neighbourhood to a solemn banquet, and spared neither the noise of
drums nor instruments of music, to deceive them as to our purpose. At
the feast, every one vied with each other in uttering the most piercing
shrieks, now of revelry, now of war. The savages sang and danced
in French fashion, and the French after the manner of the Indians.
Presents were given and the greatest tumult was kept up to cover the
noise of forty of our people outside, who were launching the boats. The
feast was concluded, the guests retired and were soon overpowered by
sleep, and we slipped out by the back way to the boats.

"The little lake on which we sailed in the darkness of the night froze
as we advanced. God, however, delivered us and, after having advanced
all night and all the following day, we arrived in the evening at Lake
Ontario. The first day was the most dangerous. Ten or twelve Iroquois
could have intercepted us, for the river was narrow, and ten leagues
down the stream it leaped over a frightful precipice. It took us four
hours to carry our boats around it, through a dense and unknown forest.
The perils in which we walked made us shudder after we escaped them. We
had no bed at night but the snow, after having passed entire days in
icy water.

"Ten days after our departure we reached the St. Lawrence, but it was
frozen and we had to cut a channel through the ice. Two days after our
little fleet nearly foundered in the rapids. We were in the Long Sault
without knowing it. We found ourselves in the midst of breakers, with
rocks on all sides, against which the mountains of water flung us at
every stroke of our paddles. The cries of our people, mingling with
the roar of the waters, added to the horror of the scene. One of our
canoes was engulfed in the breakers and barred the passage through
which we all had to pass. Three Frenchmen were drowned there; a fourth
fortunately saved himself by clinging to the canoe. He was picked up at
the foot of the Sault just as his strength was giving out and he was
letting go his hold. On the 3rd of April we landed at Montreal at the
beginning of the night."

At Montreal, the fugitives were received with tender solicitude and
the graphic details recounted at length. Thus the first attempt to
plant Christianity in New York territory, after two years had come to a
disastrous end.

Radisson, the half-civilized Frenchman, who had spent his early manhood
as an adopted Iroquois, had accompanied Ragueneau from Montreal to
Onondaga and back, tells the story in his "Travels." He dwells mostly
on the occurrences of the feast, when the Indians gorged themselves
so, that it was suggested to the priest by a Frenchman, probably by
Radisson himself, that the fugitives should massacre them in their
helpless drunken stupor and sleep--a suggestion which Ragueneau
repudiated.

The surprise of the Onondagas next day was afterwards learned. "When
night had given place to day," wrote Ragueneau, "darkness to light, the
barbarians awoke from sleep and, leaving their cabins, roved around our
well-locked house. They were astonished at the profound silence that
reigned there. They saw no one going in or out. They heard no voice.
They thought at first that we were at prayer or in council but, the
day advancing, and the prayers not coming to an end, they knocked at
the door. The dogs, which we had designedly left behind, answered by
barking." Radisson's account adds that the idea of a religious ceremony
going on within was stimulated by a pig who had a bell rope attached to
his leg, so that whenever he moved the bell pealed.

"The cock crows which they heard in the morning," says Ragueneau, "and
the noise of the dogs, made them think that the masters were not far
off, and they recovered their patience, which they had lost. But at
length the sun began to go down, and no person answering either to
the voice of men or the cries of the dogs, they scaled the house to
see what might be the condition of our men in this terrible silence.
Astonishment now gave place to fright. They opened the door; the chiefs
enter, descend to the cellar and mount to the garret. Not a Frenchman
made his appearance, dead or alive. They thought they had to deal with
devils."

This was further borne in upon them, because they had seen no boats.
A search in the woods not revealing the fugitives, they came to the
conclusion that the Frenchmen had vanished, and might as mysteriously
reappear, to fall upon their village.

The news of this disaster and the fear of a terrible uprisal at the
hands of the frustrated Iroquois caused the governor to issue the
ordinance of March 18, 1658, which was promulgated by Bénigne Basset,
the successor to Notary Saint Père. In this the habitants were again
ordered as formerly to provide themselves with arms and to fortify
their houses; not to endanger their lives, but to work as far as
possible in groups; to retire to their homes at the sound of the
bell at night and not to leave until next morning without absolute
necessity. They were not to go far for their hunting expeditions
without special permission, and they were not to use any of the canots
or chaloupes that were not their own without the express consent of the
proprietors, unless it was a case of saving life.

Such precautions as these manifested the prudence of the governor and
was the reason why there had been only one Frenchman killed between the
date of the Point St. Charles massacre, October, 1657, to April, 1660.
This solitary death was that of Sylvester Vacher dit Saint Julien, who
was slain in 1659 near the Lac des Loutres close to the town. We may
mention here several of the means adopted this year and the following
to secure public safety. On the east, a new mill was built on a rising
mound, afterwards called Citadel Hill, which was later the site of
Dalhousie Square and is now the site of the Viger station. This was
fortified as a redoubt and, together with the old fort mill at Windmill
Point on the west, guarded the river front.

In addition the Sulpicians built two fortified farmhouses as redoubts
or citadels in the extreme ends of the settlement to guard the
labourers there--that of Ste. Marie on the east and that of St.
Gabriel, named after M. Gabriel de Queylus, on the west. M. de Queylus
interested himself in city planning also and he mapped out the lines on
which the city should extend. An important protection was also secured
by the construction of a well of one hundred feet in diameter, built
by Jacques Archambault at the order of the governor, "in the middle of
the court," or of the "place d'armes" of the fort, as it read in the
contract of October 8, 1658. So far the water used had been supplied by
the river, but fear of invasion and siege, and possible burning of the
fort by the Iroquois, rendered this precaution very wise. In the next
year, 1659, a similar well was placed in the hospital garden by order
of M. de Queylus, and in the following year, 1660, a third contract
was signed by Jacques Archambault for Charles Le Moyne, Jacques Leber
and Jacques Tessard, for the mutual assistance of their houses near
the hospital; and during this year also a storehouse of 60 by 30 feet
was built by Francis Bailly dit Lafleur in the interior of the fort to
guard the grain of the hospital.

The war was now in full swing.

After the visit of the refugees from Onondaga, the Montrealers in 1658
were in daily fear, for while Three Rivers was being attacked about
June 13th by the Iroquois, a similar onslaught was valiantly repulsed
at Ville Marie. At Quebec the new governor general, Pierre de Voyer,
vicomte d'Argenson, who had arrived on July 11th, experienced his first
acquaintance with his hazardous position, when he was aroused at his
meal on the next day by the cry of "aux armes."

Such excitements added to his anxieties in settling the dispute as
to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, occupied him constantly. These
being solved satisfactorily for a time, to the great delight of the
Montrealers, the "grand vicaire" of the district of Montreal, M. de
Queylus, arrived about the end of August, 1658.

"On August 21st, he had left Quebec 'aegre' (with chagrin)," wrote
Father Vimont in a later letter to the general: "but to the great joy
of the Jesuits, who had a stormy time with M. de Queylus during his
conflict there." On the 26th of August Father Pijart, now at Quebec,
writes to his superior in Rome, "Vivimus hic quieti, ex quo Dominus
Abbas de Queylus mandato Domini archiepiscopi Rhotomagensis alio
abiit--We are living here in peace since the Abbé de Queylus has gone
elsewhere by order of the archbishop of Rouen." (Arch. Gen. S. J.)

The Sulpician, Dollier de Casson's, account runs thus: "He went to
console Montreal by his presence and to dwell there to the great
happiness of all, especially to the lively satisfaction of MM. Souart
and Galinier, who did not fear to advance well in front in the wood
without any apprehension of the Iroquois, to get ahead of his bark
coming up the river to testify to the joy that they had at his return."
He was followed by six persons from Quebec who filled three chaloupes.
In this dangerous time such protection was necessary. M. Faillon, in
his history, says that it seems that the greater part of this company
"joined to do him honour."

Certainly his advent would have given no one at Montreal more
satisfaction than Marguerite Bourgeoys and Mademoiselle Mance, who were
waiting for him.

In the spring of 1657 Marguerite Bourgeoys became interested in
building a chapel in wood on land granted for the purpose by
Maisonneuve, at some distance from her home. The ecclesiastical
superior was then Père Pijart, who gave her permission and named it
in advance "Notre-Dame de Bon Secours." "Our Lady of Good Help," as
a standing prayer against the Iroquois. Père Siméon Le Moyne laid
the first stone in the spring of 1657, and Lambert Closse, acting
governor during the absence of M. de Maisonneuve, placed the necessary
inscriptions on a copper plate. Marguerite and her sisters laboured
themselves and were helped by the settlers; some carted sand, others
wood, and others acted as masons. Everyone was personally approached by
her for some service, however small. In the spring of 1658 she applied
to obtain the permission of M. de Queylus, then still in Quebec, but he
ordered her to suspend her work till his return, which was not until
the last week of August, for he did not wish any other enterprise
to conflict with the establishment of the parish church. Thus the
operations came to a standstill till 1659, when it was finished.[79]
The arrival, therefore, of M. de Queylus was awaited with anxiety by
Marguerite Bourgeoys and Jeanne Mance. The latter, having fallen on
the ice on January 28th, 1657, had been suffering with a dislocated
right wrist and had lost the use of her hand in spite of the efforts
of the local surgeons. She had found herself useless for her hospital
work. Thus she was desirous of the help of the Hospitalières of St.
Joseph, promised but not sent, since the buildings to accommodate them
had not yet been constructed. Besides, there were not enough funds to
maintain them, so that now Jeanne Mance approached M. Queylus with her
idea of visiting Madame de Bullion for the additional funds and then
to bring back the Hospitalières. In addition she could consult the
best physicians in France on the cure of her wrist. The grand vicaire
approved of her journey.

At the same time Marguerite Bourgeoys, seeing herself without workers
for the future development of her teaching institution, asked
permission to accompany Mademoiselle Mance, who needed assistance in
her crippled condition, and to seek teachers among her old friends of
the Congregation of Troyes.

But although M. de Queylus had consented to the plan of Jeanne Mance,
he nevertheless was desirous of seeing the hospital work undertaken by
a branch of the Quebec Hospitalières, whose acquaintance he had made.
Consequently under the pretext of change of air, he had two of them
sent on to Montreal, and these arrived two days before the departure of
Jeanne Mance and Marguerite Bourgeoys.

Jeanne Mance, however, had no intention of giving the control of the
hospital to any but the La Flèche Hospitalières, and being, by the act
of foundation, the administratrix of the Hôtel-Dieu, she appointed a
pious widow known as "Mademoiselle" de la Bardillère, to replace her,
and the continuance of the Quebec nuns in Montreal was only justified
by the acceptance of the invitation of Marguerite Bourgeoys to teach
school during her absence. The two foundresses left Ville Marie on
September 20, 1658, and embarked at Quebec on a merchant vessel on
October 14th. They proceeded to La Flèche to see M. de la Dauversière
and thence to Paris. At the touch of the casket containing the heart of
M. Olier, her biographers tell of the complete cure of Jeanne Mance's
helpless wrist and hand, the news of which spread among the pious
ladies and supporters of the Company of Montreal, and created a great
sensation in Paris.

Before we narrate the outcome of the visit to France of Jeanne Mance
and Marguerite Bourgeoys, who returned on September 7th to Quebec, and
also the events leading up to the coming of Laval on June 16th, we
shall still keep the setting of Montreal as the background of our story.

So far we have considered Maisonneuve as a military governor. He was
also a judge. This was a special privilege superadded to his commission
as a "gouverneur particulier," which office, _per se_, did not include
the administration of justice. Several of his judgments being extant, a
study of them reveals a picture of the social life of Montreal hitherto
unconsidered.

The journal of the Jesuits relates that towards September, 1648, a
drummer had been condemned to death at Montreal for a detestable crime
not specified, but as the clergy were secretly opposed to the execution
of the sentence, it was arranged that he should be sent to Quebec to
use his right of appeal. There the sentence was commuted to service
in the galleys or, in exchange for his liberty, he should exercise
the duty of public executioner, which latter condition was accepted.
Heretofore there is no record of any condemnation to death.

Sometimes the cases coming before Maisonneuve were of a purely domestic
nature. On July 3, 1658, two women having quarrelled, each laid a
complaint against the other of bad language. The wrong appearing to
be on both sides, Maisonneuve gave each twenty-four hours, for their
anger to evaporate, and to declare before Basset, the greffier, and
two witnesses, that they had spoken in pure anger. If either of them
refused she should pay fifty _livres_ to the parish church and besides
be forcibly constrained to acknowledge her fault. Both wisely took the
cheaper course, as the acts of Basset prove.[80]

De Maisonneuve's skill had been shown in a judgment of July 13, 1656.
A brave soldier, Saint Jacques, one Sunday morning when coming out
of church after mass, had been attacked with a stick at the hands of
an irate woman. He gallantly did not retaliate but contented himself
with taking the case before the governor. The good lady was present,
confident in the justice of her cause, for she accused the soldier of
having got his deserts by her trouncing for having uttered a calumny
against her honour. On cross-examination it appears that she heard
the calumny, through another soldier, who related it to her as coming
from the lips of Saint Jacques. This witness being called, he now
owned that he had told the calumny to the woman but he had invented
the story himself out of frivolousness, and that Saint Jacques was
guiltless. This malicious meddler was ordered by Maisonneuve to pay a
fine of twenty _livres_ to the church, as his offence had been against
God, and fifty to the woman for her wounded honour. She, in turn, for
having struck an innocent man was condemned to pay twenty _livres_ to
the church for the offence against God, and to pay back to the wounded
victim of her misplaced energy, the fifty _livres_ received from the
meddler.

In the case of grave public scandals de Maisonneuve had recourse to
the sentence of banishment. A soldier of the garrison, having been
appointed to be on guard at Point St. Charles, was accused of daily
absenting himself from the guardhouse of the redoubt, and being found
annoying an honest woman with his unseemly and scandalous discourse. In
his sentence of November 4, 1658, Maisonneuve says: "We have cast him
out of the garrison and condemned him to pay a penalty of 200 _livres_,
applicable to some poor girls, to help them to get married at Ville
Marie." In 1660 Maisonneuve, who was no respecter of persons, ordered
perpetual banishment to one of the principal men of Montreal[81] for an
offence with a woman; and her he permitted the husband either to send
back to her father and mother, or to keep her shut up for the rest of
her days.

We have referred to an ordinance issued in 1658 to insure public
safety. He had now to issue proclamations to safeguard public morals.
Accordingly, as his short notice of July 9th forbidding, under pain
of confiscation, liquor to be smuggled from the boats arriving in
the harbour, and requiring his permission, had not apparently been
sufficiently observed, on the 18th day of January, 1659, he drew up a
long proclamation, that was posted up by Basset, the official clerk of
justice, at the parish church next day at the end of vespers, so that
no one might be ignorant of it.

Maisonneuve, forced by circumstances revealed in the proclamation,
was determined to put down the passion for games of chance, strong
drink and blasphemy, as soon as they should show themselves. It is
not difficult to imagine excesses creeping in during the long winter
evenings in a small enclosed garrison town, where there was no outlet
for higher forms of amusement, especially as fear of invasion kept the
inhabitants closely confined. Three of his garrison, Sébastien Dupuis,
Nicholas Duval and Pierre Papin, having, through drink and gambling,
found themselves unable to pay their debts, had deserted the garrison
and fled the neighbourhood. They were arrested at a distance of only
four leagues from Ville Marie, brought back and confined in irons in
the fort on January 8, 1659.

After stating the causes leading to his proclamation of January 18th
the governor continued: "In consequence we forbid (1) Any person
whatsoever, of whatever rank or condition, an inhabitant of this
place or elsewhere, to sell, wholesale or retail, under any pretext
whatsoever, without an order from us, expressed in writing, any
intoxicating liquor, under penalty of an arbitrary fine, the payment
of which will be rigidity and forcibly exacted (à lesquelles on sera
contraint par corps).

"(2) Moreover, we interdict all games of chance.

"(3) We rescind and annul any promise, written or verbal, direct or
indirect, made or to be made, as well for the aforesaid game or for any
other sort of game, with a prohibition to tavern keepers to sue in a
court of justice for the recovery of this kind of debts under a penalty
of twenty _livres'_ fine, and of the confiscation of the sums demanded.

"(4) As for those who shall be convicted of having taken to excess
wine, _eau de vie_, or other intoxicating liquors, or having sworn by
or blasphemed the holy name of God, they shall be chastised, either by
an arbitrary fine or by corporal punishment, according to the exigency
of the case.

"(5) To obviate the above mentioned desertions we declare, by the
present observance, that all the fugitives shall be by the same
convicted of the crime of desertion; and, moreover, that all who shall
abet them in their flight, whether by concealment or assistance of any
kind, shall be considered to be guilty of the same crime."

This vigilance and firmness had its results, for we do not find any
record of any contravention of any section of the above till February
22, 1663, when a man was severely punished for drunkenness and
blasphemy.

When spring was approaching this same year of 1659, by a decree of
April 5th, knowing the restlessness of the men to go fishing and
hunting, and thus risk their own individual lives besides hindering the
establishment of a lasting peace by provoking the enemy, he forbade
them, under pain of punishment, to go to any place for hunting or
fishing where they might be in danger of falling into the enemy's hands.

Later on in the year, on Pentecost Sunday, Maisonneuve published
a decree of His Majesty, already given in council March 9, 1657,
forbidding the sale of wine or _eau de vie_ to the Indians under pain
of corporal punishment.

A picture of Montreal of this year is preserved for us in the state
papers under date of March 4, 1659, by the new governor-general, the
young Vicomte d'Argenson, who had arrived less than a year ago in
Canada and who now came in the spring of 1659 to visit Montreal.

[Illustration: PIERRE DE VOYER D'ARGENSON]

He was a man of upright conduct, virtuous life and full of devotion
for the development of the colony. He came with great ideas of his
prerogatives as governor-general in relation to the subordinate
position of a local governor such as obtained in other provinces of
the kingdom of France. But he had to be made aware of the special
privileges granted to Maisonneuve as the representative of the Company
of Montreal.

Arriving at Montreal, he expected honours paid to him such as a
governor-general would receive in France, when on entering a fortress
he would have the keys given to him with other like signs of submission.

The governor of Montreal received him with politeness, but without
absolutely refusing the keys, put difficulties in the way lest he
should seem to acknowledge his inferior position to the representative
of the Company of One Hundred Associates. The case required diplomacy
and adroitness, and Maisonneuve acted tactfully. As for receiving the
"mot d'ordre" he only accepted this on the third day and then he sent
his major for it.

D'Argenson realized the situation which the independent Maisonneuve
had created, and doubtless it is in consequence of these painful
impressions that he penned the following pessimistic description of the
settlement.

After complaining of his reception he adds: "I must talk with you
about Montreal, a place which makes a deal of noise and is of little
consequence. I speak from knowledge; I have been there this spring,
and I can assure you that if I were a painter I should soon finish my
picture of it.

"Montreal is an island, difficult enough to land at, even in a
chaloupe, by reason of the great currents of the St. Lawrence river.
These meet each other at its landing place, and particularly at a half
league below. There is a fort where the chaloupes lay by, and which
is falling into ruins. A redoubt has been commenced and a mill has
been erected on a little eminence very advantageously situated for
the defence of the settlement. There are about forty houses, nearly
all facing one another, and in this they are well placed, since they
in part defend one another. There are fifty heads of families and one
hundred and sixty men in all. Finally, there are only two hundred
arpents of land tilled, belonging to the Gentlemen of the Company, of
which a half is appropriated to the hospital, so that no more than a
hundred remains to them; and the enjoyment of these is not entirely
theirs, these arpents having been cultivated by private individuals, to
whom have been given the fruits of their labour until these Gentlemen
of the Company of Montreal shall have furnished the equivalent of their
work on the concessions belonging to the habitants."

Governor d'Argenson's short stay in Montreal makes his account
slightly inaccurate for, besides the portion of the hundred acres
already cultivated, which were only lent temporarily, the habitants
were allowed, at a convenient time, to break land on the rest of the
Domain of the Seigneurs, in quantity they required according to their
concessions, whether it was land on which timber was still standing or
where it was simply felled and not cut.

If d'Argenson had arrived later, when the reinforcement of 109 men
sent out by the Sulpicians in the fall had built the fortified houses
of St. Gabriel and Ste. Marie, his picture would have taken longer to
paint; but he arrived at a time when the labourers had to abandon their
fields for fear of Iroquois ambuscades. Still the long stretch of land,
dotted with charred and blackened stumps, between which the few tilled
arpents could be seen sparse and thin in the early spring, would have
looked a barren and a gloomy sight to a jaundiced critic had he been
able to be unimpressed by the beauty of Mount Royal dignifying the
landscape. Moreover, the little progress made after seventeen years
must have surprised him. We must not, therefore, be too hard on the
young governor-general, then thirty-three years old. For his government
was one of the best of those yet sent to represent France, and his
bravery and good judgment did much to restrain the Iroquois; but he
was abandoned by the company he represented as well as by the French
government. He could not depend on the help of Montreal to share his
expenses, nor upon the poverty-stricken habitants of Quebec. The main
support of the colony, trade in peltry, was bad at Quebec. Living was
very expensive and no laughing matter. His own salary of 2,000 _écus_
and the grant of 2,000 others for the upkeep of the garrison were not
enough to sustain the situation. It is no wonder that we find him
writing, in August, that he did not see the advantage of continuing
in his office, especially as he urged the plea of bad health. Still
he was not recalled from his arduous and unremunerative position, but
continued to give fresh proof of his zeal for the good of the colony.

Meanwhile in France, steps were being taken which would bring M.
de Laval to the ecclesiastical rule of Canada, thus unifying the
ecclesiastical system, at present endangered by the presence of two
vicar generals of the diocese of Rouen.

We have related the early events of the Montreal Company to secure
a bishop for Canada as far back as 1645. But the contention of the
Jesuits that the time was not ripe in the then unprogressive state
of the colony, together with the unsettled times, with war nearly
always impending, had delayed such an appointment. We have seen the
agitation renewed by the Company on de Maisonneuve's late visit when
their candidate was M. de Queylus; while that of the Jesuits, who were
now more ready to admit the advisability of a bishop, was one of their
former students at the Collège Royal of La Flèche and now a secular
priest, François de Laval de Montmorency. They had not desired one of
themselves to be appointed, since it was not in accordance with their
constitution to seek dignities, and consequently in 1650 the names
of the Canadian Jesuits, Charles Lalemant, Ragueneau and Le Jeune,
submitted by the Company of the Hundred Associates, were withdrawn as
candidates by Goswin Nickel, the vicar general of the order.

We have seen sufficient of the ecclesiastical troubles between Père de
Quen, the ecclesiastical superior of Quebec, and M. de Queylus, that
of Montreal, both "grands vicaires" of the archbishop of Rouen, to see
that a bishop was necessary to restore the unity of government. The
experience that the Jesuits had had of M. de Queylus made them more
anxious than ever to push their candidate.

François de Laval was born on April 30, 1622, in the Château de
Montigny-sur-Aure in the diocese of Chartres, of the illustrious house
of Montmorency. At the age of nine years he was sent to the Royal
College of La Flèche, taught by the Jesuits, to commence his literary
studies. He finished his philosophy course in 1641, and during that
time he had made the acquaintance of many Jesuit priests who afterwards
joined the Canadian mission. The next four years he studied theology at
Paris, till 1645. It was thought that he would take priest's orders,
but on the death of his two brothers in 1644 and 1645 he was persuaded
by his cousin, the bishop of Evreux, to renounce his canonship in the
cathedral of Evreux and take his brother's place in the family in
caring for his mother, Madame de Montigny. The bishop died on July 22,
1646, not before repenting of his advice to François, whom he exhorted
to go back to the priesthood, and he named him archdeacon of the
church of Evreux. Laval now renounced his right of primogeniture and
his title to the Seigneury of Montigny in favor of his brother, Jean
Louis de Laval, and taking his degree in canon law, received priesthood
orders on September 22, 1647.

[Illustration: MGR. FRANÇOIS DE LAVAL DE MONTMORENCY]

Fur three years he remained in Paris and associated with the
congregation of pious laymen and others, mostly graduates from Jesuit
colleges. In 1650 he joined a small group of five of these earnest men
who lived in common in a kind of religious life under the direction
of the Jesuit, Père Bagot, and a society was formed under the title
of the "Society of Good Friends," with the purpose of charitable and
social work. These five men were increased to twelve, of whom some were
priests.

In 1652 the Jesuit, Père de Rhodes, one of the most remarkable men
of the Cochin-China missions, came to Paris in search of recruits to
form an ecclesiastical hierarchy, and it fell to the lot of three of
the priests of the Society of Good Friends to be chosen to have their
names sent to Rome as suitable bishops for the purpose, François
Paillu, canon of St. Martin de Tours; Bernard Picquet (or Piques),
doctor of the Sorbonne, and François de Laval, archdeacon of Evreux.
The long negotiations did not end till 1658, when Paillu was named
vicar apostolic of Tonkin, and two others of the above society vicars
apostolic of Cochin-China and China.

In the meantime in 1657, on the nomination of Queylus for the bishopric
of New France, the Jesuits made their overtures to Laval to adopt him
as their candidate for the same post, and he accepted. The curia at
Rome moved slowly and it was not till fifteen months later that the
bull naming the Abbé François de Laval de Montigny, bishop of Petrea
in Arabia and vicar apostolic of Canada was promulgated. On December
8th, the papal nuncio consecrated him in the church of the abbey of St.
Germain-des-Prés.

When the archbishop of Rouen, Mgr. de Harlay, who had looked upon New
France as a part of his diocese, heard of this, he resented it and
obtained a decree of the parliament of Rouen ordering word to all the
officers of the kingdoms and the subjects of the king, to refuse to
accept the new vicar apostolic.

Louis XIV on March 27, 1659, retorted by letters patent bidding
acceptance of Laval, but on the other side he wished "that these
episcopal functions should be exercised _without prejudice to the
rights of the jurisdiction of the Ordinary_, that is to say the
archbishop of Rouen; and that, while awaiting the erection of a
bishopric, of which the titulary occupant shall be the suffragan of the
archbishop."

Rome objected to the concession granted in the clause "without
prejudice to the rights of the jurisdiction of the Ordinary" because it
could not admit the pretensions of the archbishop of Rouen. However, M.
de Harlay, supported by Mazarin, maintained his position and Laval left
La Flèche on Easter Sunday, April 13, 1659, for Canada, accompanied by
the new superior of the Jesuit missions, Father Jérome Lalemant, who
had formerly worked in the missions and now came, sent by the general
of the Jesuits, Goswin Nickel, at the special request of Laval.

He arrived unannounced at Quebec, on June 16th, as a simple vicar
apostolic, a bishop indeed, but with his see in far-off Arabia,
and shorn of the dignity of canons and a chapter, and the external
emblems of a bishop in his own see. The colony could not support,
with its scanty revenues, such a position. Still he was the first
ecclesiastical superior, and thus he brought unity to the church
government, then split between the superior of the Jesuits at Quebec
and the Abbé de Queylus, at Montreal.

On arriving Laval found the colony in two divisions: on the one
side, the majority, composed of the missionaries, the communities of
religious women, and those colonists most sincerely devoted to the
church; on the other the governor, the partisans of the Abbé de Queylus
and a group of traders who scented trouble on the appearance of a man
whose unflinching character would not allow him to truckle his duty or
his conscience.

The situation was greatly cleared when, seven weeks after the arrival
of Laval, de Queylus went down from Montreal, reaching Quebec on
September 7th, and gave his submission and ceased to be grand vicaire.
At first he was uncertain whether his own powers as independent head of
the church in Montreal still held good, but the letters patent of the
king, dated March 27, 1659, received by d'Argenson, left no doubt on
the point.

Thus submission was made all the easier because de Queylus did not know
of the determination of the archbishop of Rouen to maintain him in his
function in Montreal. Indeed new letters patent, with a letter from the
king, dated May 11, 1659, were now on the way, confirming him in his
position without prejudice to the jurisdiction of the vicar apostolic.

On May 14, 1659, the king, repenting of his letter to Mgr. de Harlay,
sent two _lettres de cachet_, one to Laval and the other to Governor
d'Argenson, derogating the appointment of May 11th.

The king's letter to d'Argenson contained this: "The letter that I have
accorded to the archbishop of Rouen, it is my intention that neither
he nor the grands vicaires shall avail themselves of, until by the
authority of the church it has been declared if this archbishop is in
the right in his pretension that new France is in his diocese."

All these letters arrived by the St. André on September 8th, with the
reinforcement brought back by Marguerite Bourgeoys and Jeanne Mance.

After the conflicting nature of their contents were mastered the
position of de Queylus remained as after his submission.

Queylus returned to Montreal and later came back to Quebec, from which
he departed on October 2d on the St. André on its return voyage.

The causes of his departure are shrouded in silence, and in guarded
words d'Argenson writes: "I do not send you the reasons in writing for
fear lest the letter shall fall into other hands."

Dollier de Casson says: "After the arrival of the reinforcement and
of the Hospitalières at Ville Marie we witnessed the return of M. de
Queylus to France, which afflicted this place very much," adding as a
commentary: "Thus in this life are its sweets mixed with bitterness."
Laval in his letter to the Propaganda laconically says: "In Galliam
ipse transfretavit" (he sailed over to France).

This would look as if the voyage was of a voluntary nature. It was
otherwise. Laval feared the opposition of de Queylus; he looked upon
him as a rival, a disturber of the peace by his continued presence
in the country, and had written to France shortly after his arrival,
asking a _lettre de cachet_ for his removal. M. de Queylus was a
powerful personality and had the support of an active minority. Already
on his return to Montreal in the previous year the two other secular
priests, chaplains of the convent, at Quebec, had left Canada on this
account, and sixty persons had accompanied him on his journey back to
Montreal on that occasion.

After his recent visit to Laval and while he was welcoming new recruits
at Montreal, the _lettre de cachet_ arrived for his departure.

Speaking of the position of Laval after the receipt of the letter
of May 11th, the journal of the Jesuits on September 7th says that
"he disposed all things sovereignly at Quebec and Montreal." Laval's
critics would translate it "imperiously" or "high-handedly," for,
according to the history of Canada by M. Belmont, Laval, in acquainting
de Queylus of his recall persuaded the governor to assist the departure
of his friend from Montreal with a squad of soldiers; or rather, as M.
d'Allet, his secretary, reports in his _Mémoire_, "with a considerable
number of our men as for some military expedition." But may not this
escort have been one of honour and protection in war time rather
than one of ignominy? The governor general himself carried out this
order and this escort may therefore have been appropriate on such an
occasion, both for the governor and his friend. Two others were removed
with the late grand vicaire, M. d'Allet and another Sulpician, though
d'Allet got no further than Quebec, at which place sickness detained
him during the winter.

We can imagine the grief of the Montrealers watching their departure at
the little harbour at the mouth of the St. Peter River near the fort.
But though silenced at present, Queylus is not finally suppressed,
for we shall find him back again at Montreal before the end of two
years. In the meantime he was determined to clinch the matter of the
disputed jurisdiction. Before leaving, however, he had the satisfaction
of having received on September 7th at Quebec, and having accompanied
to Montreal, the new recruits led by Jeanne Mance and Marguerite
Bourgeoys, whose experiences, since leaving Ville Marie in the previous
year, must now be chronicled.

After the cure of her hand and wrist on February 2, 1659, Jeanne Mance
visited Madame de Bullion, who gave her 22,000 _livres_, of which
20,000 were to be set aside for the annual income to support four
Hospitalières at Montreal, from M. de la Dauversière's foundation at
La Flèche. In addition, this lady paid Jeanne's passage and gave her
presents for the church as well as money to assist struggling families
in Montreal. In all, Madame de Bullion had given 60,000 _écus_ or
1,000,000 _francs_ to the Montreal work.

At Troyes, Marguerite Bourgeoys had been equally successful, having
received the co-operation of three workers, Edmée Chastel (Aimée
Chatel), Catherine Crolo, and Marguerite Raisin. Mademoiselle Catherine
Gauchet de Belleville also joined the party. She was the cousin of M.
Souart and came from the parish of St. Sulpice in Paris. She was then
sixteen years old. In 1665 she married Migeon de Brausaat. At La Flèche
three Hospitalière Sisters of St. Joseph were chosen: Judith Moreau
de Brésoles, Catherine Massé and Marie Maillé, with Marie Polo, their
servant, and the departure of the party from La Flèche was fixed for
May 25th.

[Illustration: DEPARTURE OF THE THREE HOSPITALIERES FROM LA FLECHE FOR
CANADA]

But they did not leave peaceably, for there was a party at La Flèche,
which had resented the previous consignments of "pious young girls"
that had been previously taken to Montreal through the instrumentality
of M. de la Dauversière, it being alleged that this enthusiast, as
he was thought, had done it against the wishes of their parents.
Open persecution broke out against him. Dollier de Casson tells us
that there was a popular resentment; each one murmured, "M. de la
Dauversière is leading these girls away by force; we must stop it."
In their anxiety many could not sleep that night; but next morning,
May 26th, M. Robert Saint André, an admirer of M. de la Dauversière,
who, with his wife, was returning to Montreal, forced, with the
assistance of other gentlemen, a way on to the ship for the girls,
at the point of the sword. On reaching Rochelle M. Dauversière's
party was met by agents from Mgr. Laval, who wished to restrain their
departure on the ground that they were not wanted in Canada, as one
institute of Hospitalières was sufficient. We have seen that even M.
de Queylus was of this opinion. But M. de la Dauversière's resolution
was unshaken. "If they do not go this year they will never go." The La
Flèche institute had been founded for Montreal; the departure of the
Hospitalières had been delayed several years. He now carried his point.

New embarrassments arose. The owner of the ship, doubtless influenced
by the agents, refused to weigh anchor without the passage money being
paid in advance; he appears even to have profited by this circumstance
to raise the price. But Jeanne Mance, never to be taken by surprise,
immediately obtained the money from a merchant in consequence of a
contract which she made with a group of colonists who were coming "en
famille." These latter obliged themselves, on June 5th, before Notary
Demontreau, as a body to reimburse their debts to her in two years. In
addition they were indebted to Jeanne Mance for 199 _livres_ 8 _sols_,
which she turned over for hotel expenses to Daniel Guerry, mine host of
the Grâce-de-Dieu.[82]

The above money was not to be paid, however, till ten years after, when
Mademoiselle Mance gave them a deed of acquittance in 1669, made out by
Maître Basset, the town clerk.

At last the recruit force for Montreal was ready and it embarked on
the St. André (Captain Poulet) on June 29th. Besides the ladies with
the two foundresses, there were two Sulpicians, MM. de Vignal and
Le Maître, and a body of sixty-two men, and forty-seven women, or
marriageable girls honest families, most of whom were from Marans
in Saintonge and more or less interrelated, who were sent out at the
expense of the company and of the Hôtel-Dieu, the third of the trilogy
of religious institutions to minister at Montreal in this early period.
There were other settlers who paid their own expenses. In addition
there were sixteen or seventeen young women for Quebec.

The St. André, containing about two hundred souls, set sail for
Rochelle on July 2d. It was a veritable pesthouse of infection, having
been used as a hospital troop-ship two years ago, and it had never
been quarantined, so that hardly were they on their way when the
contagion declared itself. The food of the emigrants was the poorest;
the accommodations of the barest and most primitive description; the
supply of fresh water very limited. For two months sickness and furious
tempests and contrary winds afflicted the wretched vessel. Eight or
ten died, but most were sick, among them Marguerite Bourgeoys but
principally Jeanne Mance, who was reduced to the last extremity. The
ship became a hospital and among the devoted nurses none were more so
than the women for the Hôtel-Dieu of Montreal.

At last Quebec harbour was reached on September 7th but disembarkation
took place next day. Here the sick were landed, a work in which Mgr.
de Laval gave his personal service, "tending the sick and making their
beds," as the Annales of the Hôtel-Dieu relate. The hospital was filled
with the convalescents but the rest of the Montreal party put up at the
storehouse sheds of the "Magasin de Montréal."

Marguerite Bourgeoys was the first to be able to lead her party from
Quebec and she arrived at Montreal just a year after her departure, on
September 29th, carrying the little Thibaudeau baby (the three other
Thibaudeau children had died on the ocean) that she had tended on the
voyage and which she had allowed the father to nurse at Quebec, but he,
unlucky wight, having let it get burned, she had again taken care of
the poor sufferer on the journey up the river.

Mademoiselle Mance remained behind, still too sick to travel.
Moreover, the opposition of the vicar apostolic Monseigneur de
Laval, to the Hospitalières for Montreal, had to be met. He examined
their constitution, drawn up by a married man, M. de la Dauversière,
and found it different from other congregations. They wore secular
clothing. Though erected canonically in October, 1643, they only
took simple vows and they had not yet received the approbation of
Rome. He thought it would be better for them to go back to France or
seek admission to the Hospitalières of the Hôtel-Dieu of Quebec, a
constituted regular institution, which could form a branch to serve
Montreal. But their superior, Judith de Moreau de Brésoles, and her
companions, did not acquiesce with either suggestion.

Moreover, a practical difficulty of money matters prevented this, for
the Associates of Montreal had declared they would withdraw their alms
altogether, if any others went to the Hôtel-Dieu but those already
chosen, and in addition if the Quebec Sisterhood should take up the
Hôtel-Dieu at Montreal, that part of the foundation given by Madame
d'Aiguillon for Quebec should be diverted to Montreal. This solved the
difficulty for, as Mère Jucherau, in the Annales of the Hôtel-Dieu of
Quebec, says: "Monseigneur liked to keep up our community with its
revenue rather than to share our funds between two houses, neither of
which could support the other."

On October 2d the Hôtel-Dieu Sisters of Montreal left with full
authorization to exercise their work until ordered otherwise. On
October 20th they received from Maisonneuve the act of the "prise de
possession" of the Hôtel-Dieu, dated from the governor's house, which
was still in the fort. On October 26th the St. André returned to
France, bearing the Abbé de Queylus, as before related. Jeanne Mance
started a week later for Montreal but she was here on November 3d and
had the satisfaction of being present at the marriage of the widow,
"Miss" Bardillières, whom she had left in charge of the hospital and
who now wedded Jacques Testard, Sieur de la Forest. It was a notable
wedding, the witnesses' names including, besides Jeanne Mance, those
of Maisonneuve and the governor of Three Rivers and many notables.
Hospital work has since conduced to match-making in Montreal as
heretofore.[83]

Ever since the flight to Montreal of the French from Onondaga under
Dupuis on April 3, 1658, there had been constant fear of a concerted
attempt by the Five Nations to exterminate, by fire and slaughter, the
whole French population. In 1659 a Huron refugee to Quebec brought the
news of the preparation of a great allied army for this fell purpose.
This was confirmed at Quebec in the spring of 1660 by an Iroquois
captive ally; that 800 Iroquois had assembled at Roche Fondue, near
Montreal, to be joined by 400 more who were even then pouring down upon
Quebec by way of Montreal and Three Rivers. Believing that Montreal
and Three Rivers were besieged, Quebec was in the throes of alarm.
The outlying houses were abandoned. Most of the settlers were either
concentrated in the fort or in the Jesuit house, while the Ursulines
and Hospitalières and others were in Upper Town; the rest barricaded
themselves with many guards in the Lower Town. The monasteries, denuded
of their occupants, were also guarded, and the cries of "qui vive?" of
the patrol, each night warned the Iroquois lurking around that all were
on the alert, and restrained any attempt to set fire to the houses.

That the enemy never came, is due to the heroic venturesomeness of a
band of young Montrealers who had meanwhile bearded the lion in his
den, and diverted the attack from the French, thus saving New France.

The garrison of Montreal had thought long of how to meet the threatened
invasion, till at last the daring plan of a young officer of
twenty-five years of age, Adam Dollard, was accepted. In the spring of
1660 the officers were now, besides the governor, Major Raphael Lambert
Closse, M. Zacharie Dupuis, Pierre Picoté de Bélestre and the young
Adam Dollard, Sieur des Ormeaux. Major Lambert Closse had been married
on July 24, 1657, and he was now no longer living in the fort, for he
had been given by the Associates, in recognition of his bravery and his
merits, his own lands, the first fief granted in Montreal, a hundred
arpents, "à simple hommage et sans justice." He had now received
letters of nobility, for whereas before he has simply been styled
sergeant major of the garrison, in his marriage contract he is named
"écuyer" (esquire), on December 9th after the arrival of Maisonneuve
and that of the Sulpicians, he is called "noble homme, écuyer." We have
already mentioned that he was the commandant of the Island of Montreal.
On leaving the fort Lambert Closse still retained his office of major,
but he was replaced at the fort by M. Zacharie du Puis, the same who
had been received coldly at Quebec after the retreat under him from
Onondaga, but whose services were welcomed and esteemed at Montreal by
the governor, de Maisonneuve, who named him assistant major; and he
is also spoken of as "commandant of the Island of Montreal," a title
found ascribed also to Lambert Closse. Then we may class Charles Le
Moyne, the official interpreter and storekeeper, as in some way an
officer. Among the late arrivals two others had been at least adjoined
to the military staff. One of these was Picoté de Bélestre, a doctor
as well as a fighting man, and he proved of valuable assistance to the
settlement. Dollier de Casson says of him that "he adorned this place,
as well in war as in peace, on account of the advantageous qualities
he possessed for one and the other." He is spoken of sometimes as a
"commandant," sometimes as an officer of the garrison.

The other is Adam Dollard, Sieur des Ormeaux, a young man of
twenty-five years of age. There is little known of his antecedents.
The actual date of his arrival is not certain but, according to the
latest researches made by Mr. E. Z. Massicotte, city archivist of
Montreal (April, 1912), the first document, in which his name appears
as witnessing a land transfer, is dated September 10, 1658.

As he figures frequently in acts after this, it is not likely that he
came much before that date, for he was not present on December 29,
1657, at the marriage of Jeanne Le Moyne with Jacques Leber, a young
man of his own age, nor at that of Michel Messier and of Anne Le Moyne,
February 18, 1658; while after the above date, on September 15, 1658,
he was present at that of Jacques Mousseaux and of Marguerite Soviot,
and on October 3, 1658, he was godfather to Elizabeth Moyen, daughter
of Lambert Closse and Elizabeth Moyen, married the year previously, and
thenceforward he appeared frequently at public ceremonies.

In this act, Dollard is styled "_volontaire_," a volunteer, which may
signify that he was only as yet attached to the garrison or that he had
taken service freely and not on wages. The Notary Basset gives him,
sometimes, the title of "commandant"; at others that of "officer of the
garrison."

Mr. Massicotte proves, from the inventory of Dollard's effects after
his death, that he had intended to settle, having formed a building
society, explained before as then customary, with Picoté de Bélestre,
to break land and to cultivate it in view of a future homestead. We
have the record of de Bélestre's concession and of a debt to be paid
to the succession of "the late Adam Dollard" the sum of 79 _livres_, 10
_sols_, for fifty-three days' work, by men employed by the deceased to
work on the same concession.

It is therefore probable that Dullard was contemplating his own
homestead and that, in his turn, de Bélestre would assist, according to
the contracts before noticed.

Dollard was by no means wealthy; indeed the number of his personal
effects at his death was less than those shown in the inventories
of the greater part of the settlers dying before him, even of the
bachelors. The sum total of these possessions has been estimated at
eighty-five _livres_, or 1,700 _sous_! But we must remember that a
_sou_ would at that time buy five to ten times more than now.

The quality, however, of his varied but slight wardrobe and of the
articles of toilette not mentioned in other inventories gives ground
for the tradition that he was of a superior caste to the ordinary
colonist. The ordinary tradition is, following Dollier de Casson, that
this young man of good family had already had some command in the
army in France, but had done some foolish act, and that he had joined
Maisonneuve with the desire of doing some notable deed of valour or
self-sacrifice to rehabilitate himself in his own eyes, and those of
his friends.

The spelling of his name has been a subject of controversy. Mr.
Massicotte has established that there is no doubt, since we have his
signature at the city hall archives, that he signed himself "Dollard."
"Daulat" and "Daulac," the variant readings, are the mistakes of
copyists writing phonetically rather than orthographically, since
the three are pronounced practically the same. There is a scarcely
imperceptible nuance of sound differing.[84]

We have given these minute facts, since the exploit we are about to
relate is one of the most stirring and notable in Canadian history, and
the story of Montreal can well expatiate on one of its own heroes.

Adam Dollard it was who, by his boldness, persuaded de Maisonneuve
from his Fabian policy of defence which had, as we have seen, made
him, so far, content to drive the Iroquois away from the fort to their
ambuscades around. In April, 1660, he obtained permission from the
governor to take a band of volunteers up country and there do battle.
The fear of the Iroquois must have been indeed desperate for one so
young to have secured such a permission from Maisonneuve.

Dollard's enthusiasm, which had led the sixteen young men, two of whom
were thirty and thirty-one years of age and the rest between twenty-one
and twenty-seven, and most of whom had arrived in 1653, to strike
hands with him to follow him if the governor gave consent, now spurred
them on to make all the needful preparations. In order to purchase the
necessary arms, food and boats to man the expedition, we find records
extant of loans being sought as, for example, the following, signed by
Dollard with his own private _paraphe_, or flourish, after his name,
according to the custom of the time:

     "I, the undersigned, acknowledge my indebtedness to Jean Haubichon
     of the sum of forty _livres_ plus three _livres_ which I promise
     to pay to him on my return. Done at Ville Marie, the fifteenth of
     April, sixteen hundred and sixty.

                    Dollard (with paraphe)."

Major Closse, Picoté de Bélestre and Charles Le Moyne would gladly
have thrown in their lot with him, but prudence suggested to them that
they should finish the spring seeding, and then to lead forth a body
of forty men. The impetuous Dollard could not brook delay. Besides he
wanted the command, and this was his opportunity in life. Moreover, his
young men were eager to start. Before leaving on their perilous path
to glory, they swore a sacred oath of fidelity among themselves not to
ask for quarter, and the better to keep their plighted word and to face
death without fear, they resolved each to make his will and to clear
his consciences by a confession of his sins, and to approach in a body
the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, the symbol of unity and fellowship.

Each point was faithfully carried out. The sight of these young men at
this last solemn event in the parish church must have been thrilling to
their friends and families, fearful, yet proud of the warriors who were
setting out, perchance to die for their king and their faith.[85]

At last, on April 19th the flotilla of canoes started up the stream,
but when nearby to an adjacent island (probably St. Paul) they heard
a cry of alarm. Thinking that, near at hand, was the quarry they
were going, so far, to seek, Dollard bore down upon the Iroquois,
repulsing them with such vigour that had they not taken to the woods,
leaving behind their canoes and spoils to save their lives, they would
assuredly all have been captured.

But this victory was attended by the loss of three of his men--Nicholas
Duval, a servant at the fort, killed by the Indians, and two others
who, unaccustomed to the management of their canoe, had been drowned in
the engagement. Dollard seized the spoils, left behind by the Iroquois,
and, moreover, a canoe which served him in good stead later in the
expedition. Meanwhile the party made their way back sadly to Ville
Marie with the dead body, without doubt to assist at the burial of
Nicholas Duval on April 20th, for the parish registers give this date.
The other bodies had not as yet been discovered.

They were joined by one of the young men who had failed in his oath
and penitently sought to redeem himself. Thus the seventeen was now
complete.

As men, who might never see their friends again, they bade a general
adieu to Ville Marie, and again embarked on the fateful journey whence
no one returned to tell the tale. Though bold of heart, many of them
were not expert at handling their canoes, so that they were delayed
eight days at a rapid (Ste. Anne's) at the end of the Island of
Montreal. But their indomitable courage surpassed their inexperience,
and they reached, on May 1st, the end of the tumultuous rapids of the
Long Leap, or the "Long Sault," at the foot of the Chaudières Fall, on
the Ottawa River, at a distance of about eight or ten leagues above
Montreal.

There Dollard found a dilapidated war camp abandoned by the
Iroquois, the previous autumn. It was not flanked, but defended only
by a wretched palisading. It was dangerously overlooked too by a
neighbouring wooden slope. Within this feeble fortress, for want of
better protection, he cantoned his men and there awaited the canoes of
the enemy who must come down the Sault in single file on their return
from the chase.

Soon, to their surprise, a body of forty Hurons and four Algonquins
came with credentials from the governor of Montreal, requesting Dollard
to admit them to a share in their glorious enterprise. These were
led by the chief, Anontaha, the Huron, and Mitiwemeg, the Algonquin.
Anontaha had descended from Quebec with his Hurons, the relics of a
once powerful nation, to waylay Iroquois returning from hunting, and at
Three Rivers he had met Mitiwemeg with his Algonquins on a like quest.
Having challenged each other's valour, they determined to push to
Montreal, where likely there would be an opportunity with the Iroquois
to test each other's courage in the fight. Arrived at Montreal the
French, "whose fault, it is," says Dollier de Casson, "to talk too
much," told them of the whereabouts of Dollard's expedition. Amazed at
the daring of so slight a force, and jealous of having been forestalled
in the work of falling upon the Iroquois, they sought permission
to join them; there the vaunting chiefs could show their valour.
Accordingly they arrived with de Maisonneuve's letter which warned
Dollard not to put his trust in their bravery, but to act as if he had
his Frenchmen alone to help him.

Dollard received their parties to his future sorrow. Thus reinforced
the anxious warriors bivouacked around the redoubt, near the
hoarse-sounding waters of the leaping rapids. At last, those on scout
duty reported the coming of the advance guard of 300 Iroquois down the
stream. These were on their way to join the 400 more at the Richelieu
Islands to attack Three Rivers, Quebec and then Montreal.

Down to the place where they would likely land, Dollard led his men and
ensconced them in ambush, till two canoes filled with Iroquois arrived,
and no sooner had these put foot on land than the land force fired into
their midst, but so precipitously that some escaped, and running across
the woods to meet their party on the shore above, cried out: "We have
been defeated at the little fort, which is quite near here. There is a
party of French and Indians there."

Their approach found the party in prayer from which they arose
hurriedly, seeking the shelter of the palisading and leaving in the
confusion their kettles slung over the camp fires preparing for their
meal.

The Iroquois quickly advanced towards the redoubt, thinking to reduce
it easily, but they were frequently repulsed, with much loss and
confusion. Driven back, and refused a parley, by which they sought
to entice the Frenchmen from the fort, the enemy began to construct
a retrenchment facing the redoubt, determined to begin the siege.
Meanwhile, during this delay, the brave defenders strengthened their
outworks (it would seem an obvious duty too long delayed) by building
a second palisading within and filling in the space between, with
stones and earth to a man's height, in such way, however, that they
were loopholes large enough to put three gunmen at each. When the enemy
began next to approach, they poured their scrap iron and lead into them
with deadly effect. To add to their rage and humiliation the Iroquois
saw the heads of their comrades placed on the tops of the stockade
palisades. They now broke up the French and Huron canoes, and putting
them into a blaze sought to fire the stockade with them. But finding
themselves unable, even with their numbers, to capture the fort, they
sent a canoe to warn the 500 at the Richelieu Islands to come to their
assistance. While delaying for their reinforcement they blockaded the
fort, thinking at least to force it to capitulate, through thirst.
For a week the enemy's fire could not be of avail. Thirst, consequent
on the dearth of water in the interior of the fort, might yet effect
their surrender. Water was so scarce that the defenders could hardly
swallow their hominy (rough Indian corn). Their efforts at digging were
rewarded only by a little trickling stream of muddy water, altogether
insufficient to quench their thirst. Thus they were forced to make
sudden sallies to the river, 200 feet away, under shelter of the guns
from the fort, to fill their small pots of water, since they had
already lost their kettles and tin pans.

The Iroquois now called upon the parched Hurons cooped up within the
wretched hole to give themselves up and receive good quarter. Else they
would surely die, since a reinforcement of 500 men was coming.

These perfidious weaklings, listening to the voice of the tempters,
yielded, and they were to be seen deserting stealthily by the gate
or scrambling over the palisadings. This heartbreaking sight was too
much for the brave chief Anontaha, who aimed his pistol at his fleeing
nephew, "The Fly," but missed his aim in his bitter rage.

There were now only twenty-three to guard the fort, Dollard and his
dauntless sixteen, Anontaha, and Mitiwemeg and his four faithful
followers.

On the fifth day the 500 allies arrived. On they came to the fort with
their frightful war cries but quickly they retired, leaving their dead
around the fort and many others escaping, having lead within them
that made them ill content. Thus for three days the fight was hourly
renewed by the Iroquois, sometimes attacking in a body, sometimes in
bands; sometimes they battered the fortress with trunks of trees;
still the defenders would not yield, resolved to die to a man first.
This obstinate and unexpected resistance made the enemy think that the
fugitive Hurons had given a false tale of the numbers within the fort.
So the time passed for the hungering and thirsting men within, weary
and sleepless, but full of resolution, which they renewed with prayer,
till called to fight again for dear life's sake.

On the eighth day, many Iroquois would fain have given up, but the eyes
of others blazed with rage at the immortal disgrace they foresaw if
they should be set to naught by a handful of whites. They determined to
carry the fort by main force or perish in the attempt.

But this was a hardy and dangerous deed courting death. On such an
occasion it was the custom when volunteers for the first ranks were
needed, that sticks were thrown on to the ground and those that dared
pick them up were considered the bravest, and took the foremost place
of danger; so now the self-elected braves led the way for a bloody
encounter, carrying each an impromptu shield or fence made of united
logs each four or five feet in height lashed together, under shelter
of which they moved with bowed heads and crouched forms. They crept
nearer and nearer the palisade under the shower of shot from arquebus
and musketoon that rained fire and shot upon them from the loopholes
of the fort. At the gates, and on the palisade wall, the good axe and
sabre of the Frenchmen dealt out death upon the stormers. At length,
they had reached the palisade and strove to break their way in with axe
and battering ram. As a last despairing act, Dollard, having loaded a
heavy musketoon to the muzzle, and having lit the fuse, attempted to
throw it over the palisading so that it would explode in the midst of
the foe clambering up the posts or pulling them down. By ill luck it
caught an obstacle on the inside of the palisading and it rebounded
back, exploding in the fort, blinding many with its charge and killing
several of the gallant whites. This gave great courage to the besiegers
and the piles were wrenched away, and the gates forced. Breaches were
made on all sides in the fortification and a fierce hand to hand fight
of axe and sword and pistol ensued, and in the mêlée the brave Dollard
fell at last. Their leader fallen, each survivor fought like a lion
brought to bay, dealing death around until his own turn came. With
sword or hatchet in one hand and a knife in the other, maddened with
hunger, thirst and exposure, and ablaze with religious and martial
enthusiasm, they turned each upon their enemies, like madmen. But,
unable to take them alive with their overpowering numbers, the Iroquois
shot them down mercilessly, to fall upon the camp enclosure already
heaped up high with their own dead.

[Illustration: DOLLARD'S EXPLOIT AT THE LONG SAULT, MAY, 1660

(By Henri Julien)]

At last not one of the defenders was standing and quickly the
revengeful Iroquois searched among the bodies to see if any Christian
lived and could be reserved for torture later. Three others were found
on the point of death. These they shortly consigned to the flames
but a fourth they took prisoner and reserved for cruel refinements
later. Among those fallen were Anontaha, the Huron, and Mitiwemeg, the
Algonquin, with his three faithful companions. As to the treacherous
Hurons, they did not keep their word to them as they promised, but
sent them to their Iroquois villages to be afterwards burned alive to
satisfy their baulked revenge at their rough handling by the heroic
seventeen.

Some five, however, escaped and it was through one of them Louis, "a
good Christian but a poor soldier"--that the first news was brought at
last to Montreal, on June 3d, that so many of the enemy had been killed
within and without the fort that the bodies served to make a path to
ascend the palisades and pass over into the fort. Gradually the news
was confirmed by others arriving, and the truth was sifted from the
conflicting accounts of these cowards, whose stories strove to shield
their shameful desertion of their friends.

Shortly after the disaster the fur trader, Radisson, passed down the
Long Sault after a brush with the Iroquois. He visited the palisaded
fort and saw the gaping wounds in the stockade burnt by the assailants
and saw the scalps of the Indians still flaunting from the pickets. In
the neighbourhood there was not a tree, he remarks, that was not shot
with bullets. "It was terrible," he says, "for we came there eight days
after the defeat." Not until he reached Montreal did he learn of the
full significance of what he had seen.

The dearly bought victory made the Iroquois shy for a time of engaging
with the French, for if, they said, but seventeen could hold out so
long in a paltry palisaded picket against such odds, and with such
great loss to their assailants, it would be better to leave them alone
in their own houses and settlements. Thus the tide of war was checked.
The threatened extermination of the whites was averted. Quebec and
Three Rivers breathed again. It was the voluntary sacrifice of the
picked flowers of the Montreal youth, that found its Thermopylae at the
Long Sault, and thus saved Canada!

"This was the common belief at the time," says Dollier de Casson,
who arrived in Montreal in the sixth year after this event and whose
relation is the basis of all modern accounts of this magnificent
disaster, "for otherwise the country would have been swept away
and lost, which leads men to say that even if the establishment of
Montreal had only had the advantage of having saved the country in
this adventure, and of having served as a public victim in the persons
of seventeen of its sons who then lost their lives, it ought, for all
posterity, if ever Canada comes to anything, to be accounted as of some
considerable importance since it has saved it on this occasion, without
mentioning others."[86]

  "What though beside the foaming flood entombed their ashes lie,
  All earth becomes the monument of men who nobly die."

We must now descend from the poetic to the commonplace of prose. In
doing so, we shall have an insight into the customs of the time.

The inventory of the belongings of Adam Dullard, then in the possession
of his partner, Picoté de Bélestre, is preserved in the city archives
dated October 6, 1660, as well as the record of the sale by auction
which took place November 9, 1661, before the door of the house of Jean
Gervaise. Every item is recorded, belonging to the deceased down to
his night cap. Such things as a sword with a broken handle; a baldric,
of English cow leather, with iron buckles; a poor jerkin of gray with
a poor lining in the same colour; a little packet of poor linen; a
poor black hat; a bad pair of Indian racquettes, and so on. The most
valuable article was a jerkin with breeches and white hose, the whole
of superior material, estimated at eighteen _livres_. But this apparel,
according to the note adjoined, was returned by order of the governor
to Sieur de Brigeac, to whom they belonged.

[Illustration: INVENTORY OF DOLLARD'S EFFECTS]

[Illustration: DOLLARD'S PROMISSORY NOTE]

In the inventory is added the following unpaid bill:

"Declared by Jacques Beauchamp, fourteenth September, 1660. Seven days'
work in the winter at 30 _sols_ a day, 10 _livres_ 10 _sols_; plus 2
days and a half at 40 _sols_, 5 _livres_; plus for his washing during
six months, 7 _livres_ 10 _sols_; plus for the making of 4 shirts
and other smaller linens 4 _livres_; plus the sale of a black hat 4
_livres_."

The names of Dollard's companions are to be found in the parish
register for June 3, 1660, as follows: 1. Adam Dollard (Sieur des
Ormeaux), commander, aged 25 years; 2. Jacques Brassier, aged 25
years; 3. Jean Tavernier dit la Lochetière, armourer, aged 25 years;
4. Nicholas Tillemont, sawyer, aged 25 years; 5. Laurent Hébert dit La
Rivière, aged 27 years; 6. Alonié des Lestres, lime burner, aged 31
years; 7. Nicolas Josselin, aged 25 years; 8. Robert Jurié, aged 24
years; 9. Jacques Boisseau dit Cognac, aged 23 years; 10. Louis Martin,
aged 21 years; 11. Christophe Augier dit des Jardins, aged 26 years;
12. Etienne Robin dit des Forges, aged 27 years; 13. Jean Valets, aged
27 years; 14. René Doussin (Sieur de Ste. Cécile), soldier of the
garrison, aged 30 years; 15. Jean Lecomte, aged 26 years; 16. Simon
Grenet; 17. François Crusson dit Pilote, aged 24 years.

only holograph found of any of Dollard's companions. (Cf. "Canadian

The date of the heroic adventure of the Long Sault is put by Dollier de
Casson to May 26th or 27th, following the notice by M. Souart in the
parish register for June 3rd, which says, on the testimony of the Huron
Louis, that the exploit took place eight days before. But M. de Belmont
places it on May 21st. This is more likely to be correct, since we have
the records of the inventory of the goods of Jacques Boisseau, made on
May 25th, and of Jean Valets, on May 26th.

Similar sales were made of the goods of the other heroes. It is to be
noticed that nearly all left racquettes, or snowshoes, behind them, it
then being spring.

Though Montreal was for the moment the Saviour of New France, de
Maisonneuve had learned enough from the fugitives from the Long Sault
to make him fear the downpour of the revengeful Iroquois either that
autumn or the next spring. Consequently he put the town in a state of
defence--by fortifying the fort, the Hôtel-Dieu, the mill on the hill,
the lonely redoubts, St. Gabriel and Ste. Marie, recently constructed
by de Queylus and the Sulpicians, and then hastened to give the news of
the exploit of Dollard to Three Rivers and Quebec. The joyful tidings
gave Quebec pause to breathe again in peace. For five months public
prayers had been daily held in the churches for God's protection of the
country and for the five weeks preceding the news, there had been no
repose by day or by night.

Yet d'Argenson, the governor, also feared a descent upon Quebec before
the harvest, and there would then be utter famine. On July 4th he wrote
to France to have provisions sent back immediately, for "we are more
in war than ever and in still greater famine.... We have little or no
wheat, and there are three months to await for the harvest, which we
are in great danger of not gathering, if the Iroquois carry out their
resolution to ravage our lands."

Luckily there was no such disaster. Instead great joy was brought to
the colony, for on August 19th[87] sixty canoes, led by 300 friendly
Ottawan Indians, came to Ville Marie, laden with 200,000 _livres_'
worth of beaver peltry. A quarter of this was left at Montreal and the
rest taken to Three Rivers. This resumption of trade, so necessary for
the colony, gave courage, for many were thinking of leaving the country
on account of the continued warfare which crippled commerce. The
merchants were in great part recouped for their losses and the people
were enabled to buy from France the many necessities of life, which the
money from the sale of beaver skins could alone provide.

But trade and peace and the progress of Christianity could only be
secured by reinforcement from France, and this year we find d'Argenson
writing to France to show the necessity of sending troops. The Jesuit
"Relation" of this year urges the same. "Let France only say 'I wish
it,' and with this word it opens heaven to an infinity of heathens; it
gives life to this colony; it preserves for itself its New France and
acquires a glory worthy of a most Christian kingdom.

"Saint Louis formerly planted the _fleur-de-lys_ in the soil of the
crescent. Today it would be a no less glorious conquest to make a
country of infidels into a holy land than to wrest the Holy Land
from the hands of the infidel. Once more, let France's will destroy
the Iroquois and it is done. Two regiments of brave soldiers would
overthrow them."

Hope entered into the hearts of the colonists now, since France was
at peace, having concluded a treaty with Spain, and it was thought
that now was the acceptable hour, the time of salvation, and for this
purpose Father Le Jeune, then the procurator of the Jesuit missions in
Paris, before the end of the year 1660 was asked to present a petition
to Louis XIV and to plead for New France across the sea.

The king heard the "sighs and sobs of the poor afflicted colony," and
promised troops; but again New France was forgotten, except by the
Company of One Hundred Associates, inasmuch as they claimed the annual
rental of a thousand beaver skins.

The call was not to be heard for some years yet.

[84] To explain the "c" in Daulac it must be remembered that in French
manuscripts of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the final "t"
and final "c" were interchangeable, or rather written in the same
character which stood for a "t" or a "c." (Canadian Antiquarian and
Numismatic Journal, Third Series, No. 2, Vol. IX, April, 1912.)

[85] Parkman, speaking of this event in "The Old Régime in Canada,"
says: "The spirit of the enterprise was purely mediæval. The enthusiasm
of honour, the enthusiasm of adventure and the enthusiasm of faith were
its motive forces. Daulac (sic) was a knight of the early Crusades
among the forests and savages of the New World."

[86] It appears that thirty years after the famous defence of the
Long Sault, a band of a hundred Iroquois were fired upon as they
passed Bout de l'Isle to help Phipps in his attack on Quebec. Four of
the Indians were shot, and the remainder turned upon the attacking
band of twenty-five habitants recruited from the district about
Pointe-aux-Trembles and led by a certain Sieur Colombain. Sixteen of
the Frenchmen were killed, but the Indians abandoned their intended
voyage to Quebec. (Cf. The recent discovery by Mr. E. Z. Massicotte,

made by Médard Chod de Groseilliers with Charles Le Moyne. Cf. E. Z.
Massicotte in "Les Colons de Montréal de 1642-1667" and "Bulletin des
Reserches Historiques" (1904). The circumstances are as follows: In
1658 Chouard de Groseilliers and Pierre d'Esprit de Radisson started
from Three Rivers for an expedition for the west. They stopped at
Montreal and were joined by some Frenchmen. They were the first
Europeans to go as far as the south of Lake Superior, making Chouamigon
their headquarters, and thence brought down to Montreal the largest
convoy of furs hitherto known. They arrived shortly after Dollard's
disaster in the month of July. To make the convoy as profitable as
possible Chouard de Groseilliers made the act of "Société" with Charles
Le Moyne to divide the profits of the sales of the peltry brought down
by his Indians, at Montreal, Three Rivers and Quebec. This is doubtless
one and the same party as that of August 19th, mentioned above, who may
have reached Montreal later with de Groseilliers.

The year 1661 saw the renewal of hostilities of the Iroquois from
Montreal to Cape Tourment, "but," says Marie de l'Incarnation writing
in September of this year, "Montreal has been the principal theatre of
their carnage."

On February 25th a party of Montrealers were going to work in the
fields unarmed, not fearing any ill, since there was usually no fear
of Iroquois attacks at this early season, when suddenly they found
themselves surrounded by sixty of their foes. There was only one weapon
among them and that a small pistol borne by Charles Le Moyne, and,
unable to defend themselves with their tools, they sought safety in
flight to the town, but not without thirteen being captured.

On March 24th 200 Iroquois fell upon a body of Montrealers and captured
ten. Had they not been now armed the numbers would have been more.
The "Relation" of this year, speaking of these losses says: "After
the capture of the thirteen in the month of February, ten others fell
into the same captivity. Then later more, and still more, in such sort
that, during the whole summer this island was constantly harassed by
these goblin imps who sometimes appeared on the outskirts of the woods,
contenting themselves with hurling insults at us; sometimes they glided
stealthily into the midst of the field, to fall upon the workmen by
surprise; sometimes they drew near our houses, ceaselessly annoying us,
and like unfortunate harpies or evil birds of prey, would swoop down on
us unawares."

Of the ten captured in March four were butchered in the neighbouring
woods; their bodies, brutally dismembered, hacked and burned, were
discovered by the dogs of the town, who came back each day glutted with
blood. This led to their being followed to their foul feasting place.
"Such disasters made the people turn their thoughts to eternity," says
the pious Dollier de Casson. "Vice was then almost unknown at Ville
Marie, and in the time of war, religion flourished there on all sides
in quite a different manner than it does today, in that of peace."

Three Rivers and Quebec suffered similarly. Near Quebec the sénéchal
of New France, M. Jean de Lauson, son of the former governor, fell a
victim on June 22nd. On this same day a picturesque scene occurred at
Montreal, when two canoes of Iroquois arrived under the protection of a
white flag of peace, and bringing with them four French prisoners. It
was an embassy of the two nations Onondaga and Oi8guere, who professed
to be neutral. They parleyed offering the release of the four prisoners
and twenty others at Onondaga; requesting that hospital sisters such
as those at Quebec should be sent them, and insisting as the main
condition of the release that a black robe be sent. M. Maisonneuve
sent this proposal on to Quebec with the result that Father Le Moyne,
the Jesuit, was deputed to accompany the ambassadors to Onondaga. On
the arrival of Father Le Moyne at Montreal the four Frenchmen were
exchanged for the eight Iroquois prisoners held, for a year past, in
Montreal.

After their departure other Iroquois onslaughts resulted in the death
of Jean Valets, at Point St. Charles, on August 14th, of the Sulpician
M. Lemaître, and that of Gabriel de Rée with him on August 29th, near
St. Gabriel's fortified farmhouse. M. Lemaître was saying his breviary
in the fields and acting as a lookout, somewhat apart from the fourteen
or fifteen workmen, when he suddenly came across an ambush of sixty
Iroquois. Seizing a cutlass and facing the savage crew, he called
out to the workers to hurry with their arms. He was now shot by the
Iroquois and running towards his friends he dropped down dead. These
managed to make their way to the farmhouse but left one man, Gabriel
de Rée, dead on the field. The Iroquois cut off the heads of each, and
one of them, a Christian renegade, put on the dead priest's soutane,
and wearing a shirt over it for a surplice, went stalking around the
body in mockery of the Christian burial service. The early memoirs of
this event further tell that the head of the murdered priest had spoken
after being severed from the body, and that when it had been carried
away in a white handkerchief, probably taken from the pockets of his
soutane, the features of the dead man became perfectly imprinted upon
it. This handkerchief had been seen in the camp by a French prisoner,
Lavigne, who tried in vain to obtain possession of it for, recognizing
the features of the dead priest, he had learned of his massacre. This
story he told to Dollier de Casson, who records it in his "Histoire de
Montréal."

Meanwhile the party that had taken Father Le Moyne to Onondaga with
the promise of leading back the twenty French prisoners in forty days
had not returned, and great fear was entertained at Montreal for
their safety. On October 5th, however, nine were brought back by the
intercession of the friendly chief named Garacontié, the rest having
been kept behind with Father Le Moyne during the coming winter.

On October 25th another disaster occurred in the little island à la
Pierre, above St. Helen's Island,[88] whither a party had gone the
day before to quarry stone for the new seminary, for up to this the
Sulpicians still dwelt in the Hôtel-Dieu. Along with the party, joining
them on the second day, was M. Lemaître's successor as "economus;"
another Sulpician priest, M. Vignal, who went to supervise the work.
Hardly had the party in the first boat, in which was M. Vignal, put
foot to land, when they fell into an ambuscade, and M. Vignal was
pierced with a sword, along with Sieur de Brigeac, a young soldier
of thirty years of age; M. Maisonneuve's private secretary, René
Cuillérier, and Jacques Dufresne. M. Vignal was thrown in the enemy's
canoes and taken to La Prairie de la Madeleine, facing Montreal. The
rest of the French escaped, except Jean Baptiste Moyen, who was left
mortally wounded.

After two days they put the priest to death, roasted his body on a
funeral pyre and ate it. His bones were never found. This death gave
great grief at Montreal as well as Quebec, for M. Vignal it will be
remembered had been the chaplain of the Hospitalières there.

After this cruel and horrible repast the party broke up; the Mohawks
took Jacques Dufresne with them, while the Oneidas led away the Sieur
de Brigeac and René Cuillérier. Both of these were condemned to be
burned and de Brigeac, after being horribly mutilated and slowly
burned, succumbed after twenty-four hours' torture, "praying," as the
Historian de Casson relates, "for the conversion of his tormentors
without uttering a cry of complaint."

The same fate awaited Cuillérier, but he had an intercessor in the
person of the sister of the chief, who wished to adopt him as her
brother. Eventually he escaped to the Dutch at Fort Orange, and he
finally made his way back to Montreal in the following year.

During the summer the Vicar Apostolic, Mgr. Laval, made his first visit
to Montreal. He was received with honour on the evening of August 21st.
On this occasion he showed great solicitude for the Hospitalières of
the Hôtel-Dieu, who, by the failure of M. Dauversière, now become a
bankrupt, had lost the funds entrusted to him, and had nothing to live
on, unless the one thousand _livres_' income, granted to the Company
of Montreal by Madame de Bullion for the support of a hospital, was
transferred to them. They were now thinking of going back to France,
but Mgr. Laval arranged, on the request of the inhabitants of Montreal,
that the income of the hospital could support them.

At the same time Montreal was visited again by the Abbé de Queylus. He
arrived at Quebec, incognito, on the third day of August. Since his
absence he had not been idle in pushing the ecclesiastical position
of Montreal, for on calling on the vicar apostolic, he astonished him
by communicating to him the results of his visit to Rome, viz., the
apostolic Bull of the Dateria, creating Montreal into an independent
parish, and a mandate from the archbishop of Rouen charging the
bishop of Petrea to preside at the installation of M. de Queylus as
the canonical "parochus." Finally the vicar general reminded M. de
Queylus of the _lettre de cachet_ of February 27, 1660, forbidding
his return. Queylus retorted by quoting a contradictory "_lettre de
cachet_" annulling it. The vicar general refused to accept the Bull of
the Dateria on the ground that it was obtained surreptitiously, and he
cancelled the jurisdiction of Rouen as incompatible with his own as
vicar apostolic. On August 4th he forbade Queylus to go to Montreal
under penalty of disobedience. This he communicated to d'Argenson,
but the night of the 5th or 6th of August saw de Queylus making for
Montreal furtively by canoe, with no obstacle placed in his way by the
sympathetic governor. M. de Queylus had large landed property interests
in Montreal, in fact he was one of the largest proprietors and one
of its chief mainstays. It was therefore argued that he could not, as
a private individual, be stayed from attending to his business there.
On the 6th, Laval issued the ecclesiastical suspension of de Queylus
unless he returned to Quebec. Meanwhile the abbé remained at Montreal
and no doubt received Laval on his official visit of August 21st,
already mentioned. On August 29th he grieved with his brethren over
the massacre of his fellow Sulpician, M. Lemaître, and he performed
several important business transactions as "Superior of Ecclesiastics
Associated for the Conversion of the Savages."

In the meantime Laval had written to Rome exposing his case. He
looked upon the peculiar pretensions for ecclesiastical monopoly of
Montreal and the presence of Queylus, as injurious to the interests
of the church in Canada, as menacing its unity and fostering schism.
Accordingly prevailing in this view, his protests brought letters
demanding the return to France of M. de Queylus, which took place
October 22d, from Quebec, the new Governor d'Avaugour being intrusted
with its execution.

It is well to avoid reading into these ecclesiastical disputes personal
hostility or the clash of rancour among high placed churchmen. Each
would have fought, lawyer-like, on principle, for a case of canonical
jurisdiction not yet settled in the ecclesiastical courts, owing to the
doubt remaining as to the validity of the overlordship of Rouen and
the acquiescence of Rome in its pretensions. Law at that time seems
also to have been unsatisfactorily managed, and the facility with which
"lettres de cachet" were sent to and fro, countermanding one another,
did not tend to simplify matters, as we have seen.

Add to these the difficulties inherent in the foundation of a young
French colony and the inevitable struggles for precedence and "locus
standi," especially among representatives of a nation that adored
etiquette and the preceding quarrel will be looked upon as an
interesting episode in a difficult period of history rather than as an
ecclesiastical scandal needlessly resuscitated by the historian, for
the purpose of opening old sores. Later on it will be seen that when
the archbishop of Rouen had relinquished his pretension, de Queylus
returned in 1668 as Laval's appointed vicar general at Montreal, and
the Sulpicians had no greater friend than the fighting bishop.

The same remarks could apply to the struggles that had been going on in
Quebec between Laval and d'Argenson in the matter of social precedence.
The relations of the church to the state had not been clearly
defined in a new country, primarily established for the promotion of
Christianity, and it would still take some time to straighten them out.

On September 11th of this year d'Argenson was formally succeeded in
the reins of office by the Baron du Bois d'Avaugour, arrived on August
31st, but it must not be understood that his quarrels with Laval
were the cause of this. The Vicomte's term of office, as we know,
had already been renewed for a second term, and he had sent in his
resignation more than once, urging ill health as an explanation. His
loss was, however, felt at Montreal by the Sulpicians, on whose side he
had ranged himself in the above disputes with Laval. His administration
would have been more successful if he could have been more impersonal
in such encounters.

M. d'Argenson was shortly followed to France by the founder of
Boucherville, Pierre Boucher, ex-governor of Three Rivers. He left on
October 31st on a mission as special agent to promote the recognition
of the need of national help from France, if Canada was to remain a
white man's land. He was sustained by the new governor, d'Avaugour, and
by d'Argenson, now in France; with what success we shall hear.

[Illustration: SEAL OF THE BOUCHERVILLE FAMILY]


1662

The parish register of Montreal has the following sad entry:
"1662-February 6. Le Sieur Lambert Closse, sergeant-major de la
garnison; Simon Le Roy, Jean Lecompte et Louis Brisson,[89] tué par les
Iroquois."

On this date, February 6th, the brave Lambert Closse met his death at
the hands of those he had so often withstood. The place of the combat
was somewhere near the corner of Craig Street and St. Lambert Hill. A
tablet placed by the Antiquarian Society erected on the south corner
of St. Lambert Hill and St. James Street, near the site of his house,
reads: "Near to this place Raphael Lambert Closse, first town major
of Ville Marie, fell bravely defending some colonists attacked by
Iroquois, 6th February, 1662. In his honour St. Lambert's Hill received
its name."

His biographer, Dollier de Casson, says he died "as a good soldier of
Christ and the king." He was one of those chivalrous knights who looked
upon the Montreal venture as a holy crusade against the infidels, and
death to him was victory. "Gentlemen," he once explained, "I am not
come here, except to die for God in the service of arms. If I did not
believe I should die so, I should leave this land and go to fight
against the Turk so as not to be deprived of this glory." He left
behind his young widow of nineteen years, Elizabeth Moyen, and a child,
Jeanne Cécile Closse, now two years old. Some colonists, being fallen
upon in the fields by the Iroquois, Lambert ran, as was his wont, to
their assistance. He would have saved them had he not been basely
deserted by a cowardly Fleming, his serving man. The historian of the
"Relations" for 1662 says, "He has justly merited the praise of having
saved Montreal by his arms and his reputation."

On May 6, 1662, Picoté de Bélestre signalized that Montreal had still
brave men to follow in his footsteps by the brilliant defense of the
Fort Ste. Marie. This redoubt on the east, with the corresponding
outlying one, on the west, of St. Gabriel, was a most valuable
fortress, without which, as a writer has remarked, Montreal "would have
been snuffed like a penny dip."

The Fort Ste. Marie was opposite the little rapid, down the harbour,
still known as Ste. Marie's Current, and was placed among some fifty
acres which had been cleared and cultivated in prehistoric days by the
Indians. The site of the above event is recorded by a tablet on the
corner of Campeau and Lagauchetière streets: "Here Trudeau, Roulier and
Langevin-Lacroix resisted fifty Iroquois." The three men were returning
to the habitation after their day's work in the fields, when suddenly
one of them cried: "To arms! The enemy is upon us!" At the same moment
a large party of Iroquois, who had been lurking here all day, rose and
fired. Each Frenchman seized his musket and fled to a hole nearby,
called "the redoubt." This they held stoutly till rescued by Bélestre,
the commandant of Ste. Marie. After a brisk fight the enemy finally
retired to the woods.

Apart from these alarms from the Iroquois, a new danger to life had
arisen from the drunken fits of the Indian allies. On the night of June
23-24 Michel Louvard dit Desjardins had been slain before his door in
Montreal by a savage, "Wolf." This produced the following ordinance
from de Maisonneuve on June 24th:

"In consequence of the murder committed last night on the person
of one named Desjardins by drunken savages, caused by the sale of
intoxicating liquors, notwithstanding previous prohibitions given both
by the Baron du Bois d'Avaugour, lieutenant general of His Majesty, and
Mgr. the Bishop of Petrea, vicar apostolic; after having considered,
in consequence of the sales of these drinks, the dangers of a general
massacre of the inhabitants by the savages, for which there are weighty
presumptions, having regard to the ordinary insolences of these latter,
and considering, besides, the ordinary crimes committed on this subject
by the French, of which we shall shortly inform the Baron d'Avaugour
and the Bishop of Petrea, so that there shall be established good order
on the subject of the sale of liquors, as well as for the good of the
inhabitants and for the savages; we, while awaiting this order by
virtue of the power we have received from His Majesty, have prohibited
and do now prohibit all kinds of persons, of whatsoever quality and
condition, from selling, giving or trading intoxicating drinks to the
savages, under such pains and punishments as we shall judge proper to
inflict, to procure the service of God and the good of this habitation."

This looks but just and wise; but it was also bold, seeing that
the prohibition of the sale of liquor was at that moment a burning
question at Quebec. It was especially bold, seeing that Maisonneuve
adroitly challenged the governor general to stand by his own previous
legislation, which he was now tacitly neglecting to enforce. It will
be seen that de Maisonneuve made reference to powers "we have received
from the king." Shortly after the publication of this ordinance the
Baron d'Avaugour visited Montreal and he flatly doubted the right to
introduce these words, especially as he had lately taken the stand of
permitting liquor traffic with the Indians. As the governor of Montreal
had been used slightingly and jealously of late by the governor
general, he did not show him his documentary authority, although the
reader will remember that the royal edict of March 7, 1657, warranted
the words.

This marriage contract between Lambert Closse and Elizabeth Moyen must
have been signed by Jean de St. Père, the first notary of Montreal,
but his signature appears to have faded. The flourishes or _paraphes_
at the end of the names were customary at the period to insure against
imitation.

This is now the place to introduce the famous quarrels about the
liquor trade, which were of passionate interest in New France in the
seventeenth century.

It is claimed by the French that the English were the first to
introduce the liquor curse to the natives, in payment for furs. When
the French returned to Quebec the traders followed suit in spite of the
prohibitions of Champlain, Montmagny, d'Ailleboust, de Maisonneuve, de
Queylus and Laval.

The letters of the Jesuit missionaries and the contemporary
memorialists reveal a shameful story of vice, mingled with that of
the establishment of a Christian civilization. Drink made the savages
and the Christian neophytes yield to the most deplorable depths of
immorality and barbarous brutality. The delights of conviviality gave
way to disgusting debaucheries, quarrels and bloody fights. Fathers
slaughtered their children; husbands, their wives; and the women became
veritable furies. Children, boys and girls, were all demoralized. After
a night's carouse the cabins of the Indians were a gruesome sight,
heartbreaking to those responsible for the morality of the country.
The good nuns were shocked at naked men and women running amuck in the
streets of Quebec, clearing all before them at the point of the sword.
Notwithstanding prohibitions and ordinances, the scenes of carouses and
of carnage continued, because the minority, the traders, maintained
the right as necessary for trade alliances with the natives, asserting
that they were not responsible for the abuse. On his arrival Laval
fought the custom fiercely and finally found himself forced, on May 6,
1660, to fulminate the terrors of the church's excommunication "ipso
facto" against the traffickers, and in this he was supported by the
Jesuit missionaries. This had a decided effect, backed up by the severe
sanctions, even those of death, promulgated by the secular arm of the
state, represented by the Baron d'Avaugour.

An unfortunate incident, trivial in itself, destroyed this harmony. It
came from the characteristic inflexibility of the soldier governor. He
had all the qualities of a soldier who, having made up his mind, is
immovable, but he had the defects of these same qualities. What in a
good cause would have been constancy in maintaining a point of honour
became pigheadedness and impracticability in another. A woman of Quebec
had been taken, selling a bottle of wine to the Indians. Her friends
and relatives interceded for her to the priest, Father Lalemant, who
in turn approached the governor. The governor must have been in a bad
humour and not very philosophical, for he did not distinguish between
clemency and justice, between a general command and an extenuating
circumstance, or legitimate exemption. It was the priest's part to
urge clemency, the governor's to exercise justice. Father Lalemant
was answered brusquely: "Since the selling of _eau de vie_ is not
punishable for this woman, it shall not be so for anyone"--the answer
of the man of the sword and not of the lawyer or statesman. Soon the
word went around that the governor tolerated the liquor traffic. The
obstinate and headstrong soldier would not retract his hasty words and
disorders began again. The governor was inactive and shut his eyes,
but Laval levelled his threats again at the traders, who now openly
revolted, saying they would not be dictated to by bishop, priest,
preacher or confessor, since the viceroy was on their side.

It was under these circumstances that de Maisonneuve issued his
ordinance forbidding at Montreal what was known to be permitted at
Quebec. Hence the passage of arms between the two governors as
described. Maisonneuve was supported by the clergy of Montreal. Affairs
went from bad to worse at Quebec and on August 12, 1662, the vicar
apostolic went to France to place the liquor situation before the king.
Thither also went the secretary of the Baron d'Avaugour, Péronne de
Mazé, to justify his master and the traders.

Charge and countercharge, and recriminations, exercised the French
court. The bishop and the Jesuits were accused of too much severity and
clericalism, the governor and traders of too much laxity and avarice.
The problem of the relations of church and state had still to be worked
out in New France. In the meantime the bishop won; the Sorbonne in
1662 had justified his action; the liquor traffic was forbidden and
d'Avaugour was to be recalled. When Laval returned next year, the new
governor, de Mésy, accompanied him, the man of his own choice--an
unfortunate one as we shall see.

The month following, September, 1662, de Maisonneuve wished to go
to France, his object being to secure troops and to arrange for the
transfer of the seigneurship of the island from the nearly moribund
Company of Montreal to the Seminary of St. Sulpice. Before leaving he
appointed the town major, Zacharie Dupuis to take his place and an
ordinance to that effect was put up at the door of the parish church
dated September 10, 1662. On September 16th he started with Jeanne
Mance and the Abbé Souart, conducted by M. Jacques Leber. When at
Quebec d'Avaugour forbade Maisonneuve to depart on the ground that he
was needed in Montreal to quell the sedition that had arisen there in
July in reference to the establishment of a storehouse by the Company
of One Hundred Associates. This was but a pretext. Maisonneuve,
however, consented to return. Mademoiselle Mance set sail alone on
September 20th.

On his return to Montreal Maisonneuve busied himself in promoting
agriculture. There were four classes now living at Montreal:
The "habitants," or settlers, who took up the lands and were
self-supporting, these alone having the rights of trading in peltry;
the soldiers of the garrison; hired workers by contract for a definite
time; and day labourers.

By an ordinance of November 4, 1662, Maisonneuve gave permission to
soldiers and hired workers to cultivate four arpents on the seigneurs'
domain, till four others equally cultivated were given them elsewhere.
As a further inducement, those taking up land would be granted peltry
privileges like the habitants. Sixty-three responded to this before the
end of the year.


FOOTNOTES:

the wharf terminus of the Champlain branch of the Grand Trunk Railway.

[89] Two of these were "travailleurs ou volontaires," or day labourers.
In his ordinance of November 4, 1662, Maisonneuve showed no favour
to these who, for the most part, were rather a charge on the young
colony than a benefit. At Three Rivers they early became a considerable
nuisance. In 1653, on January 14, Pierre Boucher, the local governor,
ordered them to become habitants, or servants of habitants, and on
March 2, 1668, he made a new ordinance conceived in these terms: "On
the advice which has been given us that there are still labourers who
are neither habitants, nor servants of habitants, and who live under
the name of 'volontaires' (free workers), we forbid them to take more
than twenty sous a day and fifteen _livres_ a month with their food,
under penalty of prison and of the cat-o'-nine tails (fouet) at the
hands of the hangman, and it is forbidden them to trade any peltry
with the savages." At Montreal at this date the labourers were not
so troublesome, but out of them later developed many of the restless
"coureurs de bois."

Meanwhile the war was still in progress and news had come that the
Iroquois had determined to seize Montreal, by surprise or force, as
their own post, after putting the inhabitants to fire and sword. To
meet this threat, de Maisonneuve issued an ordinance, January 27, 1663,
inviting the colonists to form into militia squads of seven persons of
which one should be elected corporal, for the purpose of supplementing
the regular garrison soldiers. On February 4th "to the end that the
country may be saved," he established a _camp volant_, or flying
squadron, composed of twenty such squads, to be known under the title
of the Militia of the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, "since
this island is the property of the Holy Virgin." It will be remembered
that already de Maisonneuve had established his Military Confraternity,
or guard of sixty-two. In all things the religious character of the
foundation of Montreal is seen.

At Quebec the liquor traffic with the Indians went on more boldly,
owing to the absence of Mgr. Laval, and disorders were multiplied, such
as the burning of one of the houses on the night of January 23d.

An event, which is reported from many sources and was regarded as a
supernatural visitation was, however, more effective in putting the
fear of the Lord into the liquor traffickers than all the previous
thunderings of the clergy.

On February 5th, the eve of Carnival Monday, or "lundi gras," the first
hoarse rumblings of an earthquake which were noted all over Canada,
were heard at Ville Marie while M. Souart, the curé, was holding
prayers in the church, and after five or six minutes the earth began to
swell and move. The terror-stricken people left the church lest they
should perish in the ruins. At the Hôtel-Dieu, many of the sick ran out
and spent the night on the rolling snow-covered ground. The gayeties of
carnival were abandoned and fear fell upon the people. The tremblings
lasted for seven or eight minutes.

One direct effect of the earthquake was to make the ladies form, under
the suggestion of Père Chaumonot, the Jesuit, then on a visit to
Montreal, and with the co-operation of M. Souart, a pious association
under the name of the "Confraternity of the Holy Family." Its
formation, on July 31st, was greatly promoted by Madame d'Ailleboust,
widow of Louis d'Ailleboust, the former governor general, who, since
his death in 1660, had taken up her abode at the Hôtel-Dieu. It was
approved in March 1665, by Mgr. Laval. Subsequent associations spread
all over Canada for two centuries.

The pictures given of the earthquake are most graphically painted by
writers of the period, such as those in the "Relations." In the forest
the trees were apparently at war, being uprooted and cast against one
another, so that the Indians said the forest was intoxicated. The hills
and mountains were in the same confusion. Mountains were laid low and
the valleys were filled up. The ice beds of the rivers broke up and
the water, mingled with mud, poured up in jets on high. The streams
quitted their beds or changed the colours of their waters, some yellow,
others red; the great St. Lawrence was whitish for eight days. To the
affrighted people it seemed that the spirits of darkness and the powers
of the air were permitted to league themselves. But there was little
loss of life "and the harvest," says Sister Marie de l'Incarnation,
"was never more fruitful. There were no sicknesses. You see by this
that God only wounds to bless and that his inflictions which we have
experienced, are only the chastisement of a good Father." The effects
of this earthquake still are visible. From Cape Tourment to Tadoussac
there were changes in the contour of the land and of the banks of the
St. Lawrence. The picturesque name, Les Eboulements, in the Bay of St.
Paul, records the fall of a hill nearby into the river, thus forming
the present island. The earthquake spread to New England and the New
Netherlands, and similar terrors affected the minds of the people as in
Canada.

While these warlike physical changes were terrifying Canada, in France
the constitution of the bodies governing its temporal law and order
were also being overhauled in a more peaceful manner. On February
24th the few remaining rich members of the Company of One Hundred
Associates, which had the monopoly of New France since 1626, were
constrained, seeing impending dissolution by force, to offer the
resignation of their charters, by a renunciation pure and simple.

In the March following this was accepted by the king. The colony came
at last directly under the crown and happier times were in store for
it. Splendid colonizing ideas were being prepared by Louis XIV and Jean
Baptiste Colbert, the successor of Mazarin, which if carried out would
have prevented the necessity of the cession of 1760. The words of the
edict will not surprise our readers.

[Illustration: COLBERT]

"Since it has pleased God," says this prince, "to give peace to
our kingdom, we have nothing more strongly to heart than the
re-establishment of commerce, as being the source and the principle
of the abundance which we take upon ourselves to procure for our
people. This has led us to inform ourselves of the state of New France
which our king, our very honoured lord and father, had given over by
a treaty of 1626 to a company of one hundred persons. But in place
of learning that this country had been populated as it should be,
considering the long time of its possession, we have recognized with
regret that not only the number of its inhabitants is very small, but
that they are every day in danger of being driven out by the Iroquois.
Recognizing, besides, that this company of one hundred men is nearly
extinct owing to the voluntary retirement of a great number, and that
the few remaining are not powerful enough to maintain this country,
by sending forces and men necessary to swell and defend it, we have
resolved to take it from the hands of this company, which has resigned
it to our good purposes. For which reasons we declare that all the
rights of property, justice and _seigneurie_ granted by our most
honoured lord and father, by the charter of April 29, 1626, shall be
and do remain reunited to our crown, to be henceforth exercised in our
name by the officers whom we shall name to this effect."

Thus the future Canadian society was being thought out on the basis
of an over-parental feudalism, probably the best form for the times,
though it sadly crippled the initiative of the French-Canadian
population, with results seen to this day. Yet the population was no
more than twenty-five hundred souls, of which eight hundred were at
Quebec.

At the same time the negotiations for the transfer of the seigneury of
the island of Montreal were completed. During the visit of Mademoiselle
Mance several meetings of the Company of Montreal had been held, the
members of which, with the exception of some directors of the Seminary
of Paris, and M. de Maisonneuve, were reduced to five. On March 9th
the act of transfer, to be found in the Edicts and Ordinances of the
Province of Quebec, states that:

"Considering the great blessings, which God has poured upon the Island
of Montreal for the conversion of the savages and the edification of
the French, by the help of MM. Olier, de Renty and others, for twenty
years; and now, in later years the gentlemen of the Seminary of St.
Sulpice have laboured by their care and zeal to uphold this good work,
having exposed their persons and having made contributions for the
good of the colony and increase of the glory of God; the Associates
desiring moreover to contribute on their part by seconding the pious
designs of the Gentlemen of the Seminary, and in honour of the memory
of the founder and one of the promoters and benefactors of the work of
Montreal, they have, after several conferences on the subject, and in
furtherance of the greater glory of God, given to these gentlemen all
the proprietorial rights which they have in the Island of Montreal, as
also the seigneurial manor house, called the Fort, the farm, the tilled
lands and all the rights that they have in their island."[90]

In this donation special reference was made to the services of M. de
Maisonneuve. He was to continue, during his life, governor and captain
of the island and of the seigneurial manor house under, however, the
pleasure of the Gentlemen of the Seminary. He was to have, in place of
remuneration, half of the farm lands and the revenues of the mill.

He was to have his apartments in the seigneurial manor house, in which
the Gentlemen of the Seminary, as Seigneurs, shall henceforth have the
right to live.

After some hesitation, in view of the expense of the undertaking, the
Seminary of St. Sulpice at Paris, on March 31st, finally undertook the
work for which their founder had always intended them, and Montreal was
saved from the abandonment which at one time during the negotiations
looked imminent. There was a desire to have M. de Queylus sent back,
but Laval, then in Paris, was adamant in his firmness.

On his part, he was very well received at court. The king would have
Laval made "Bishop of Quebec" and he gave him the abbey revenues of
Maubec in the diocese of Bourges to sustain the position when the see
of Quebec should be erected, which was not to be for many years. The
most important preparation for the better government of New France, and
one in favor of Laval, was the edict, published in March by the king,
of the appointment of a Sovereign Council to sit at Quebec, unless
judged more convenient elsewhere. This was to consist of the governor
general, the bishop, or in default the highest ecclesiastic on the
spot, the intendant when appointed, five councillors and a _procureur
du roi_.

The nomination of these councillors was to be made conjointly by
the governor general and the bishop, and they could dismiss them or
continue them at pleasure. This gave Laval greater power than before,
for hitherto under d'Avaugour, he had only a right to be called to
the council with a "voix délibératrice," as a simple councillor among
creatures chosen by the governor general. The Baron d'Avaugour was
recalled,[91] and Laval was constrained to name his successor, his
choice falling unfortunately on M. Saffray de Mézy, then town major
of Caen, whom he had formerly met at the Hermitage of Caen, where M.
Bernières gathered his pious friends whom he thought he could rely on
to extend the glory of God. De Mézy's letters were signed on May 1st,
before d'Avaugour's second year of the usual term of three years was
completed. On March 26th Laval, in preparation for rearing a colonial
clergy, erected a seminary and united it with that of the Foreign
Missionaries of Paris, from whom he wished to draw some volunteers.

In the April following he obtained an edict from the king regulating
the "dime" for church support and the poor rate, to be fixed at the
thirteenth part of the income of each colonist. It was arranged also
that the curés should be removable at the will of the bishop and his
successors.

The bishop of Petrea reached Quebec on September 15th with the new
governor general, de Mézy, and M. Louis Gaudais, Sieur du Pont. The
latter had been sent by the king as an envoy to enquire into the
government of d'Avaugour, and in addition to report on the most
convenient means for the colonization and cultivation of the country.
The troops which the king had desired to send to subdue the Iroquois
were not as yet at liberty to come, but in their place, 100 families
containing 500 persons, with expenses defrayed for a year, were
dispatched this year.

By September 28th the new councillors, Rouer de Villeray, keeper of the
seals; Jucherau de la Ferté, M. Ruette d'Auteuil, Legardeur de Tilly,
d'Amours; and the new king's procurator, M. Bourdoin, with Gaudais, the
royal commissioner acting as intendant _ad interim_, had collaborated
with de Mézy and Laval and had issued a severe edict forbidding the
liquor traffic with the Indians.

There was now great stir under the new form of Royal Government. Mézy
and Laval were announced as Chiefs of the Council. The inhabitants made
offer of their "foi et hommage" for their land tenures. Officers for
the administration of justice, according to civil law, were appointed.
Regulations for commerce and social progress were promulgated. New
France was declared a province or a kingdom and Quebec a "town." A
mayor, Legardeur de Repentigny, and two aldermen, Jean Maudry and
Claude Charron, were elected, and municipal life seemed promised.
These officers met on October 6th, but by November 14th their election
was revoked by the council and the office of syndic again restored.
This abortive municipal life was apparently too great a stride in the
autocratic government then in vogue. Yet Canada was beginning to emerge
from its petty parish condition and its struggling state. The privilege
granted Laval of exacting one-thirteenth part of the fruits of the
earth and of a man's labour on the earth for church establishment was
not satisfactory, and finally it was reduced to one-twentieth for
the rest of monseigneur's life; later it was reduced by Laval to a
twenty-sixth.

The taking over of the colony as a royal possession began to affect
other places than Quebec. At Montreal, the assumption of the
seigneurial duties and privileges was not without difficulty. On
August 18th, the commission which had been privately given by M. de
Bretonvilliers to M. Souart was publicly ratified. But hardly had
the Sovereign Council been installed than it took away the right of
the Seigneurs to administer justice in civil and criminal cases, and
on September 28th appointed M. Arthur de Sailly as judge, Charles Le
Moyne, king's procurator, Bénigne Basset as chief clerk and notary of
the sénéchal's court, all of whom took the oath on October 19th.

Similar inferior courts of justice were also established at Three
Rivers; appeal could be made on trivial causes to the supreme council.
The customary law of Paris, or "_coutume de Paris_," based on the civil
law of Rome, was the fundamental law of Canada, and still governs the
civil rights of the people.

Hitherto Maisonneuve had acted as administrator of justice, but now the
seigneurs named Charles d'Ailleboust des Musseaux as judge and retained
Bénigne Basset as clerk of the Seigneurs.

The new appointments, made over their heads in defiance of their
rights, caused M. Souart, on behalf of the seigneurs, to go to Quebec
with M. de Maisonneuve, to protest. But while there, de Mézy dealt a
further blow by presenting Maisonneuve with his commission of governor
of Montreal, thereby intimating that the seigneurs had no right of
appointment. M. Souart, relying on the decree of 1644 giving this
power to the seigneurs, then the Company of Montreal, protested, and
he was ordered to produce the letters patent for proof; meanwhile de
Maisonneuve was to act as governor of Montreal, by the power just
granted by the governor general, till the king should order otherwise.

In the meantime de Maisonneuve acted on his new commission but always
without prejudice to the rights of the seigneurs. This loyalty was also
shared by Bénigne Basset for, in a contract of marriage for November
16, 1663, he signs himself as clerk in the royal sénéchal's court,
notary royal, and clerk for the seigneurs. It may be for this reason
that he was supplanted later in his office in the sénéchal's court by
Sieur de Mouchy, who had been appointed by the Sovereign Council "for
good reasons." Maisonneuve's position at Montreal was also getting
insecure. There was now an effort on foot to bring Montreal under
control of Quebec as the seat of the royal government and the veteran,
de Maisonneuve, as an adherent of the old ways, was jealously viewed
by de Mézy and perhaps by Laval. Certainly Montreal was now being
dominated by the newly-imported royal policy.

But the new colonial policy was to bring good results from the new
blood infused. If wisely handled, the new régime would have worked
permanent good.

The resignation of the Company of New France, on February 24, 1663, was
accepted by the king in March of the same year, and the edict on the
creation of the Supreme Council followed in the April following.

From the date of the establishment of the Supreme Council, September
18, 1663, Civil Government may be said to have begun. Hitherto no
deliberative board had sat to discuss the affairs of the colony. There
had been a vague and indefinite system of government by the chartered
companies, but there had been no constituted hierarchy, either in the
political or in the judicial order.

The council was modeled on that of the parliament of Paris. The terms
of the "ordonnance" of its creation indicated that the king wished to
create here, in Canada, an authority to supply what the parliament
of Paris, seeing its great distance away, could not provide for.
Yet the Sovereign Council was never a real parliament, although
it contained in germ, if not actually, all the power of one. The
dignity of the new body was so great later that when Frontenac came
as a governor he considerably astonished the simple burgesses of the
little fortress of Quebec with all the pomp at his command. He would
be in truth a "Viceroy," and Gascon that he was, he would play the
part. Others also in their sphere would reproduce the usages of the
Paris mother parliament; hence the troubles about "préséance," among
the counsellors, which seem so trivial to us, but not so to them,
punctilious in their observance of their high positions. With Paris
for an example, it is not surprising that Frontenac dismissed his
counsellors, when it suited him, for did not Louis le Soleil do the
same himself?

The "ordonnance" of the creation of the council, after indicating the
composition of its members and outlining its general powers, then
continues: "Moreover we give power to the said council to commission,
at Quebec, Montreal, Three Rivers and in all other places, as many, and
in the manner as it shall deem necessary, persons as shall judge in the
first instance without chicanery and delay, the procedures of different
proceedings which may arise between private persons, and shall name
clerks, notaries and scriveners, surgeons and other officers of justice
whom they shall judge proper, our desire being to drive all chicanery
as far as possible out of the said country of New France, with the end
that prompt and speedy justice may be rendered."

The Sovereign Council was held at Quebec but it ruled over Montreal,
not in broad lines of general policy only, but in what we would call
village politics. It went into very small details indeed and the parish
church portals were frequently posted with proclamations from Quebec.
There does not seem to have been much home rule for Montreal in those
days.

A picture of this period is presented in the "Histoire Véritable et
Naturelle de la Nouvelle France," dedicated to Colbert, the minister,
by a letter written from Three Rivers on October 8, 1663, by Pierre
Boucher, who had been sent to France by the inhabitants of La Nouvelle
France for help, in 1662, when he had conversed with Colbert personally.

His object was to explain the physical and natural history of the
country to encourage colonization. He expresses surprise that the
country still remained inadequately populated, but he warns Colbert
against any policy of sending criminals to this country. Tramps were
not wanted in Canada. If any insinuated themselves they knew, how to
hang them, as elsewhere. Doubtful women were not tolerated either.
Those women that came were vouched for by responsible persons or
relatives.

Speaking of the climate he says: "From the beginning of May, the heat
is extremely great, though we are only coming out of the depth of
winter. This is the reason why everything goes ahead and in less than
no time the earth is covered with verdure. It is remarkable that the
wheat sown at the end of April or as late as May 21st is harvested in
September. The winter is very cold, but it is a bright frost, and for
the most part the days are beautiful and serene.

"Mont Royal, the last of our settlements, is situated on a beautiful
and great island. The lands are very good and produce grain in
abundance; everything is going on well there; fishing and hunting are
also very good."

Montreal is described as having a rich soil, but requiring horses[92] to
till it. As these are expensive he hopes the "bon roi" would assist,
especially by exterminating the Iroquois, who killed the cattle. Most
of its trees were oak. There was no hemp, but the soil was suitable for
its cultivation.

Speaking of the caribous he says that the males have forked feet, which
in running, open so widely that they never sink in the winter snows no
matter how deep these may be. He speaks of the skill of the beavers in
constructing their dams, which the waters cannot break through, saying
that they thus arrest the courses of little streams, inundating a great
part of the country and forming pools for them in which to play and to
have their dwellings. The savages had the greatest difficulty on their
hunting expeditions in destroying these dams.

Describing social life, he says that the country produced strong boys
and girls, but they were led to study with difficulty. Wine was drunk
in the best houses, beer in others, and a favourite drink in common
use was "bouillon." Some houses were built of stone covered with pine
boards, some were built with upright posts filled in with masonry;
others were framework buildings of wood. There were no women servants
in Canada. Most of the men started as servants and in a few years
were at their ease working for themselves. He advised all who came to
Canada to be ready to put their hands to anything, building or land
clearing. They should bring provisions for two years, especially flour.
He gives many other details showing the value of money and the price of
things. The great difficulty beyond the mosquitoes and the length of
the winter was the fear of the stealthy Iroquois who were here, there
and everywhere, never attacking but when they were in strong force.
When discovered they take to flight, and as they are so agile in their
movements, it is difficult to pursue them. He trusted the "bon roi"
would assist in destroying them. "And," says Boucher, "it would not be
a difficult thing to get rid of them, for they consist but of eight to
nine hundred men capable of bearing arms. It required only prudence and
sufficient force to destroy them."

Boucher was accompanied from France by Dumont, an officer in charge of
100 soldiers. In Dumont's account of his visit, written in 1663 in the
"Relations," he says of Montreal that the inhabitants were the most
soldierly in the country--a remark made also by Boucher. Boucher's
mission to France helped to persuade the king to take over the colony
as a royal possession. When the king's forces came to exterminate the
Iroquois the Montreal fighting men did justice to their reputation, as
we shall see.

At this period the mode of living was very simple. The house was one
long room lighted by three windows, in which all the family ate, slept
and worked. At the bottom of the apartment was the bed of the parents,
against the wall; in a corner a contrivance which served as a bench by
day and a bed by night for the children. On the right, as you entered,
you would have seen the open chimney rising a little above the room,
and slung from a chain was the family cooking pot. Near the fireside
was a small staircase or ladder leading to the grain loft above lighted
by one or two small windows. A table and a few chairs or benches or a
collapsible chair and table in one, completed the primitive furniture
in the living room.

But we must not forget the old gun hanging over the bed, ready at hand
during the night should the Iroquois suddenly attack. This served also
as the family forager for meat, and game, both feathered and "red
skins." There was good shooting in the neighbourhood of Montreal,
with plenty of ducks and partridges. It is recounted that in 1663 a
hunter in Quebec brought down thirty-two grey turtle doves with one
shot. On the rivers they were so numerous that the rowers could hit
the troublesome birds with their paddles. The settlers, when they
had collected all they needed and salted there for the winter, had
abundance left over to give to the dogs and the pigs.

There was not much hunting in the woods by Montrealers, but the Indians
brought into the market near the fort, the original "place d'armes,"
a goodly amount of bear, elk, venison, wild cow, moose, beaver and
muskrats, and other meats.

On "fish days" the good Montrealer had no excuse for not keeping church
abstinence, for eels sold at an _écu_ a hundred, and sturgeons, shad,
dory, pike, carp, groundlings, brill and maskinongé abounded. From
Quebec they received the salmon and the herring, trout from Malbaie and
white fish from Three Rivers.

Provisions, clothing and property originally were exchanged by barter,
e. g., a small lot of land went for two cows and a pair of stockings; a
larger piece would go for two bulls, a cow and a little money.

Money became less rare when the troops arrived. Meanwhile the war
with the Iroquois was carried on with the usual incidents, as already
described.

At Montreal there seems to have been more fear of the exactions of
Quebec than of the incursions of Iroquois. Quebec had endeavoured to
restrain all trade to itself, and in consequence of this monopoly
prices were very high in Montreal, and many households were in want.
At the same time there were complaints as to the adequacy of the
police arrangement, so that there seemed to be ground for fearing some
sedition.

Accordingly on February 15, 1664, Paul de Chomedey published an
ordinance ordering the habitants to assemble on the Sunday following,
February 24th, to the place called the "hangar," to elect five of the
principal inhabitants to regulate the matters of police for the town.

This day, the weather being bad, saw very few at the voting place, and
we find the syndic, Urbain Bauderau, asking for a reannouncement of the
same ordinance for next Sunday, March 2d. This was done, and at least
226 were present, to judge by the votes recorded. The following were
elected police judges: Louis Prud'homme, 23 votes; Jacques Le Moyne,
23; Gabriel le Sel, Sieur du Clos, 19; Jacques Picot, Sieur de la Brie,
24; Jean Leduc, 19.

[Illustration: VOTES RECORDED OF AN ELECTION OF CIVIC OFFICERS]

Dated March 6th, another document of de Maisonneuve is preserved, in
which it is recorded that the above five had been ordered to appear
before the governor to take the oath, and had done so, but Le Sel and
Leduc, having said and declared that they did not know how to write or
sign, the three others signed the commission of appointment. Meanwhile
the position of de Maisonneuve as governor of Montreal was becoming
insecure and in June of this year he was called to Quebec by M. de Mézy
who named Captain Etienne Pézard, Sieur de la Touche, to succeed him in
his position. What the reason was, beyond the jealousy of the governor
general, or a possible secret instruction from the government, we do
not know. Yet this latter appointment never took place, for we find de
Maisonneuve still governor till his final removal by Tracy at the end
of 1665, and even then M. Dupuis, the town major, was only appointed as
commandant till Perrot was officially appointed in 1669.[93]

At Quebec the early months of 1664 were signalized by the outburst
in flame of the smouldering dissatisfactions and the growing discord
marring the harmony hitherto existing between Laval and de Mézy,
the joint chiefs of the Sovereign Council. The dual rule was found
impossible, especially as the council was considered by de Mézy to be
a packed one in favour of Laval. It came to a head on February 3d,
when the governor sent his major, the Sieur d'Angouville, to announce
to the bishop that he had forbidden three of the council, de Villeray,
d'Auteuil and Bourdon, the king's procurator, to appear at the council
until they had been justified by the king for the cabals he alleged had
been fomented against himself by them. He prayed the bishop to confirm
this interdiction of those "who had been named in his favour" and to
proceed in the nomination of three others. He did more: he proclaimed
the same interdiction at the sound of the drum by a proclamation signed
also by the three other councillors. Further, on February 13th, he
published another declaration forbidding several practices which he
said he felt bound to stop, so as not to betray the interests of the
king.

This rupture was inevitably the result of the impossible dual
government. In France the vesting of temporal power in a bishop was not
so likely to prove unsuccessful as in a new country needing a military
governor. But to place the spiritual and civil authorities "ex aequo"
in civil government was not the wise move for the good of the church it
had been intended to be.

M. de Mézy no doubt felt the weakness of his position. The moral
strength of government would be dominated by the bishop and in a
conflict the councillors and others would side with the bishop as vicar
apostolic, who was irremovable, except by the pope, until death, while
the governor general could be recalled even before his three years were
completed. Hence his patience was tried and his dignity hurt; thus he
lost his head and went beyond his powers. On the other hand, the bishop
would honestly not have been prepared for this outburst. With pain and
astonishment Laval replied, on February 16th, that he could not in
honour or in conscience ratify the suspension of the councillors until
they should be convicted of their alleged crimes against the governor.

The suspension of Bourdon, the king's procurator, held up the
administration of justice. This Mézy endeavoured to correct by
appointing, on March 10th, against the will of Laval, another, in the
person of the Sieur Chartier. He went further and arbitrarily dissolved
the council on September 18th, and on the 24th established another
without the consent and participation of the bishop.

On September 23d M. Bourdon sailed to France at the command of de Mézy
to render an account of his service to the king. In October de Mézy
published again, at the beat of the drum, another proclamation, which
incensed the ecclesiastical party.

The dissentions in Quebec could not but have a disquieting effect on
Montreal, now politically more dependent on Quebec than ever.

[92] One horse only had reached Canada previously. It arrived June 20,
1647, and was presented to the governor, Montmagny.

[93] Etienne Pézard de la Touche never acted as governor of Montreal
owing to the rigorous protestations raised by the Seigneurs of the
island. M. de la Touche seems to have arrived in Canada in 1661 and by
the 10th of October of that year he is to be found acting as lieutenant
of the garrison of Three Rivers, in which locality he remained till
1664, when he became a captain. On June 20th he married Madeleine
Mulois de la Borde and M. de Maisonneuve as governor assisted at the
ceremony. On the same day or the next by a curious irony of fate
there is found the nomination of the newly married captain, dated
from Quebec, as Maisonneuve's successor. When the news became known
at Montreal it was looked upon by the governor general de Mésy as an
arrogation of the powers of the Seigneurs of Montreal, and an attempt
on the part of the recently created Sovereign Council to test its
jurisdiction over Montreal. The triumph of the seigneurs was evident,
for on July 23d following, de Maisonneuve was accorded by the sovereign
council his emoluments for the upkeep of the garrison for the current
year, and on July 28th is found as governor granting a new concession
of land, a practice he continued till May, 1665. On the other hand,
on July 23d, de la Touche is recorded as in charge of the accounts of
the garrison of Three Rivers. On August 8th M. de Mésy apparently by
way of a consolation accorded him the seigneury of Batiscan and of
Cap de la Madeleine, and the new seigneur busied himself in his new
position. Meanwhile de Maisonneuve's days were numbered. (Cf. Canadian
Antiquarian and Numismatic Journal, 1914, No. 2, article by E. Z.
Massicotte.)

The strained relations at Quebec and Montreal were soon to be relieved
for a time by the death of de Mézy, who died on the night of May 5-6,
1665, thus being saved the painful investigations into his government
which were ordered by Louis XIV, and were to be conducted by the
new governor, M. de Courcelles, and the intendant, Jean Baptiste
Talon. They, having received their letters of appointment on March
23d, were now on their way with a secret commission to look into the
administration of the spiritual and temporal power of New France. M. de
Courcelles was given power over all the local governors of Canada, and
the Sovereign Council, to settle differences between its members, and
to have command over all His Majesty's subjects, ecclesiastics, nobles,
soldiers and others of whatever dignity or condition, but this under
the supervision of M. Alexandre de Pourville, Sieur de Tracy, who was
shortly expected to be in Canada. This latter had been appointed on
November 19, 1663, the lieutenant general of the king for _l'Amérique
Méridionale et Septentrionale_, and was to proceed to Canada as soon as
possible.

As for Talon, the Colbert of New France, and the first intendant in
Canada, he was given unlimited authority in police, civil, judiciary
and financial matters, independently of M. de Courcelles.

[Illustration: THE INTENDANT TALON]

This distribution of power was bound, in the beginning, to create
trouble. Perfect harmony could not be expected while the intendant,
though not of equal dignity with the governor, was treated with great
consideration and was looked upon to act as a check and spy on the
governor. This dual reign was as likely to cause friction as had that
of the governor and the bishop hitherto. Still it was a most valuable
and useful office in the progress of the country, and Talon used it
well.

Before the arrival of de Courcelles and Talon, on April 25th, an attack
had been made on the Hôtel-Dieu at Montreal, when four of their men
were fallen upon by the Indians; one was killed, another mortally
wounded and two others were taken prisoners. This made Montreal look
more eagerly for the arrival of the troops promised to exterminate the
Iroquois.

On June 17th and 19th, four companies of the Carignan-Sallières
regiment, which had sailed from Rochelle, arrived at Quebec, while
de Tracy himself, with the four others which had served with him in
the French Islands, reached Quebec on June 30th. In the train of
the tall and portly veteran of sixty-two, was a gay and glittering
throng of finely dressed young noblemen, and gentlemen adventurers,
eager to witness the wonders of New France. Never was such splendour
seen in Canada as that, when Laval received de Tracy and his bronzed
veterans recently come from Hungary, where they had fought the
Turks, and who now, with their picturesque soldiery accoutrements
and trained movements marched stately to the fort to the beat of the
drums. Assuredly at last the Iroquois would be exterminated by such
disciplined forces.

This infantry regiment, which at the conclusion of the war was to
leave many of its soldiers to settle down near Montreal and become the
founders of many of the best Canadian families, had originally been
raised in 1644 by Thomas François de Savoie, Prince of Carignan, the
head of the house of Carignan, who fought for France in Italy. His son,
after him, also commanded this regiment, which took henceforth the
name of Carignan. In 1659, after having joined the regiment of Colonel
Balthasar, he incorporated this with his own and it was handed over to
the French king, who placed M. Henri de Chapelais, Sieur de Sallières,
the colonel of another regiment incorporated with it, to command it
in the absence of the prince, under his orders. Hence the combination
became known as the Carignan-Sallières regiment and consisted of
about 1,000 men from the Carignan-Balthasar regiment and 200 of the
Sallières. The portion of the troop which returned to France became the
nucleus of a reconstructed regiment which under the name of Lorraine
existed till 1794.

The regiment had, however, not yet all arrived. That portion led by
Colonel de Sallières himself did not come till August 18th or 19th,
while the last companies reached New France with de Courcelles and
Talon, on September 12th. These latter added to the splendour of Quebec
"for," says Mother Jucherau, "M. de Courcelles, our governor, had a
superb train and M. Talon, who naturally loves glory, forgot nothing
which could do honour to the king." At last the numbers were complete,
but many were put into the hospitals, sick from disease, and from the
long voyage, which had taken M. Talon's party 117 days at sea. This
sickness was one of the reasons which delayed the war against the
Iroquois till next year.

Meanwhile at Montreal news had arrived of the capture on the Ile Ste.
Thérèse, of Charles Le Moyne who, in July, had been given leave by de
Maisonneuve to join the friendly "wolves" in a hunting expedition.
He, however, escaped death, for he threatened them with dire revenge.
"There will come a great number of French soldiers," he said, "who will
burn your villages; they are even now arriving at Quebec. Of that I
have certain information."

In preparation for the coming war, de Tracy, soon after his arrival,
determined to build forts at the entrances to the routes leading to and
from the Iroquois country. These were to be garrisoned by the soldiers
of the Carignan regiments so far arrived. The first fort was placed at
the mouth of the Richelieu River, to replace that originally built
by de Montmagny, and quickly ruined in 1642. It was built under the
direction of one of the officers, M. Sorel, whose name was afterwards
given to this place, A second was constructed at the foot of a rapid
of the Richelieu River and it received the name of Chambly, from
another Carignan officer. M. de Sallières constructed the third at
another rapid of the same river and it gained its name of Fort Ste.
Thérèse from the saint's day occurring on October 15th, the day of its
completion. A fourth, St. John, was built at the foot on another rapid
of the Richelieu. The fifth was built by another officer, M. Lamothe,
on an island of Lake Champlain, at a distance of four leagues from its
mouth and was named Ste. Anne.

After their completion, the soldiers were distributed for winter to
Quebec, Three Rivers and Montreal. Colonel de Sallières was in command
at the latter. As provisions were scarce in the storehouses of the
company, Talon wrote to Colbert on October 4, 1665:

"I have sent merchandise to Montreal and on the advice of M. de Tracy I
have added some ammunition from the king's stores to be distributed to
the inhabitants. But in return I expect to receive from them wheat and
vegetables, as well as elk skins, to make stronger canoes than those
covered with birch bark."

Hearing of the preparation for war, an embassy from the three upper
nations under Garacontié, the chief friendly to the French, met de
Tracy at Quebec, bringing back with them Charles Le Moyne unscathed,
and parleying for peace. But the two insolent lower tribes against
whose marauderings the forts had been built, were still contumacious
and to be punished presently.

By November, the forts were completed and the peace from Iroquois
attacks was so secure that the body of Father Duperon, the old Jesuit
missioner at Montreal, who had died at Chambly, was taken to Quebec to
be buried. This same month, on November 24th, another Jesuit well known
at Montreal, Simon Le Moyne, died at Cap de la Madeleine. He was a man
of remarkable courage, tact and ability, and his name will ever be
remembered in Canadian history as the first European recorded to have
ascended the St. Lawrence River.

[Illustration: LE MOYNE MEMORIAL AT SALINA, NEW YORK]

A greater sorrow than the imprisonment of Le Moyne was to afflict
Montreal in the enforced departure of "its father, and very dear
governor," who had served the colony for nearly twenty-four years,
and was now to be a sacrifice to the centralizing policy of the new
government, which had long looked with envy on the power of the
seigneurs of Montreal to name their governor. The policy pursued by de
Mézy, and temporarily checked, was now adopted by the Marquis de Tracy,
with no uncertain significance.

The joy at the arrival of the troops, now turned to bitterness. The
nature of de Maisonneuve's dismissal was conveyed in the appointment,
on October 23d, of his successor. "Having permitted," ran de Tracy's
letter, "M. de Maisonneuve, governor of Montreal, to make a journey to
France for his own private affairs, we have judged that we can make no
better choice for a commander in his absence than the person of Sieur
Dupuis, and this as long as we shall judge convenient." Under the glove
of velvet, can be seen the hand of iron.

This stroke of diplomacy, delicate enough in its way, cut deep enough
to wound de Maisonneuve's friends. The charge of inefficiency was
read into the veiled dismissal by Marguerite Bourgeoys, his faithful
adviser. "He was ordered to return to France," says Sister Morin, "as
being incapable of the place and rank of governor he held here; which
I could scarcely have believed, had not Sister Bourgeoys assured me of
it. He took the order as that of the will of God and crossed over to
France, not to make complaint of the bad treatment he had received but
to live simply and humbly, an unrecognized man."

De Maisonneuve was left a poor man; he had made no fortune in Canada,
as others had done. He had contented himself with being the father of
his people. His devotion and attachment to Montreal had stood in the
way of his acceptance of the governor generalship. He left under a
cloud, but his memory has been vindicated in the noble monument to him
in the Place d'Armes of Montreal. There is hardly to be found a higher
ideal of Christian knighthood in the whole history of our Canadian
heroes.

[Illustration: STATUE OF MAISONNEUVE IN PLACE D'ARMES

(By Philippe Hébert)]

On his return to France, he led a simple Christian life. His heart
was in Montreal, and in his modest home at the Fossé St. Victor, his
greatest delight was sometimes to receive a Canadian visitor, for whom
he felt a fatherly affection.

His retreat was visited in 1670 by Marguerite Bourgeoys, who thus
describes it in the account of her journey to obtain the letters patent
for her new institution: "The morning of my arrival I went to the
Seminary of St. Sulpice to learn where I could find M. de Maisonneuve.
He was lodged at the Fossé St. Victor, near the church of the Fathers
of Christian Doctrine, and I arrived at his house rather late. Only
a few days before he had constructed a cabin and furnished a little
room after the Canadian manner so as to entertain any persons who
should come from Canada. I knocked at the door and he himself came
down to open it, for he lived on the second floor with his servant,
Louis Frins, and he opened the door for me with very great joy." Many
other kindnesses did this simple gentleman do for her and for other
Canadians, for whom he acted as the kindly agent while they were in
Paris.

A true Canadian! May his memory remain forever green at Montreal! He
died on September 9, 1676, and his funeral obsequies were carried out
in the church hard by his home, above mentioned. Dollier de Casson, in
his history of the city, treats the painful incident of the governor's
departure thus:

"Speaking of the arrival of the ships and of the 'grand monde' which
came to Montreal this year, and of the extreme joy because of the
king's goodness in making his victorious arms glare and glitter, all
the same these joys were diluted for the more intelligent with much
bitterness when they saw M. Maisonneuve, their father and very dear
governor, depart this time for good, leaving them in the hands of
others, from whom they could not expect the same freedom, the same
love, and the same fidelity in putting down the vices, which have since
taken effect with those other disgraces and miseries, which had never
up to then appeared to the point at which they have since been seen."

It is commonly thought that Maisonneuve arrived at Montreal in his
fortieth year. He lived there twenty-three years. After that he spent
eleven in France, thus dying at the age of seventy-four years.

So eager was de Courcelles to carry on the war, for which the troops
had come, that they started from Quebec on January 9th, in the depth of
winter, a rash venture as de Maisonneuve could have told the Europeans.
Yet they marched out, each soldier with his unaccustomed snowshoes and
with twenty to thirty pounds of biscuits and provisions strapped on his
back, crossing the frozen streams and waterfalls, to the number of 300
of the Carignan regiment, and 100 French Canadians. They were joined
by others on the route, among them a party of 106 good Montrealers
under Charles Le Moyne. These latter were de Courcelles' most valued
men, being seasoned woodmen used to wars' alarms. He called them his
"blue coats," and found they served and obeyed him, better than the
rest. The expedition was an utter failure, for not counting the frozen
fingers, noses and limbs, they lost many men, sixty dying from want of
provisions, so that de Courcelles returned to Quebec disconsolate.

A second expedition, under Sorel, started in July. This time there
were only "thirty good Montrealers." When within twenty leagues of the
Iroquois camps, they were met by the famous chief, called the "Flemish
Bastard," with some European captives. He asked for peace, and Sorel,
believing him, marched back to Quebec with the Bastard.

De Tracy led the next expedition with de Courcelles on the feast of
the Exaltation of the Cross, September 14th. Never had so large an
army started out--600 Carignans, 100 friendly Indian allies from the
missions and 600 French Canadians, of which 110 were the "blue coats"
from Montreal under Le Moyne and Picoté de Bélestre, who led the van
to meet the brunt of all disasters as they were chosen to be at the
rear in retreat. The canoes and flat-bottomed boats started from Quebec
crossed Lake Champlain; then, they landed and portaged their boats on
their backs till they launched them again on Lake St. George (then
called Lake St. Sacrament), and proceeded up the narrows to where Fort
William Henry was afterwards built. There were 100 miles of marching
now to be endured, through forests, streams and marshes gleaming in
the Indian summer sun. Marie de l'Incarnation tells some adventures of
this journey. As each one, even the officers, had to carry his knapsack
of provisions, the fair Chevalier de Chaumont got a humour on his
shoulders. Others suffered likewise. General de Tracy was placed in a
dangerous predicament when crossing a ford. "He was one of the biggest
men I have ever seen," says the good sister, "and a Swiss soldier
was trying to carry him. When in the middle, de Tracy found himself
overthrown, but luckily clung to a rock and saved himself. From this
undignified position he was rescued by a hardy Huron, who conveyed him
safely to the other side."

But the character of this journey was the genial chaplain of the
Montreal forces, none other than Dollier de Casson, whom we have
quoted so often. Dollier had arrived in Canada on September 7th. His
venturesome spirit was enlisted at once in this expedition, in which he
was quite at home being, besides a "man of God," a "man of war," having
but ten years ago served and fought, as a cavalry officer under Marshal
de Turenne. He was a very large man, as tall as de Tracy, and stronger.
Grandet, who left a manuscript note on Dollier, says that he had such
extraordinary strength, that he could hold two men seated in his hands.
He was cheerful, courtly, courteous and genial. He had a merry and
quick jest to cheer up the "blue coats" and others, in many a tight
corner. He was doubtless the most popular man in camp.[94]

If he had lived in these days, the newspapers would have called him
the "fighting parson." Grandet, in his manuscript note on Dollier,
tells how on one occasion, being at prayer on his knees in an Algonquin
camp, an insolent savage came to interrupt him. Without rising from his
knees, the big burly missioner sent the astonished Indian sprawling
on the ground by a blow from his fist--a proceeding which gained
him admiration from the Algonquins, who exclaimed with pride in his
physical prowess: "This is indeed a man!" Probably this strength helped
him to become the great peacemaker he afterwards became at Montreal.
Dollier says little of himself in his account of the march, speaking
modestly and impersonally of himself. The big man seems to have
suffered hunger very much on the small rations dealt out to him, for he
says that "this priest made a good noviceship under a certain captain
who could be called the Grand Master of Fasting; at least this officer
could have served as novice master in this point to the Fathers of the
Desert." This "ecclesiastic of St. Sulpice," he says, "was strongly
built, but what enfeebled him was hearing the confessions of the men by
night while the others were asleep. He felt the marching pretty badly,
for his wretched pair of shoes gave way, so that having nothing left
but the uppers the sharp stones of the water beds and banks played
havoc with his bare feet. So weak and weary did he become that he could
not save a man drowning in the water into which he had plunged to the
rescue. This man happened to belong to the train of the Jesuits and
Dollier explained that it was hunger that had so enfeebled him, whereat
the good Jesuit took the good Sulpician aside and gave him a piece of
bread, made palatable with two different _sucres_, one of _Madeira_ and
the other of _appétit_."

We cannot pursue the story of the war, as it takes us too far from
Montreal. Suffice it to say that there was a complete victory, the
greatest that had ever been won against the Iroquois. After the capture
of the last stronghold of the Mohawk Iroquois, the warrior priest
chanted a Te Deum and said mass. After that, the cross was planted with
the arms of France and possession was taken of the country in the name
of Louis XIV. "Vive le roi!"

At Quebec, when the news arrived, on November 2d, there were great
rejoicings, and when de Tracy returned on the 5th the Te Deum boomed
out anew. But the army was sorely depleted; many had died from cold,
hunger and the chances of war, as also by accidents on the road,
whereas the Iroquois had lost little else than their birch bark cabins.

After the termination of the expedition, some of the soldiers were
picketed in the new forts. A chaplain was needed for Fort Ste. Anne,
and Dollier de Casson, now returned to Montreal, volunteered, although
he suffered from a swelling on the knee, to cure which he underwent a
severe bleeding at the hands of one of the local medicos of Montreal,
who did it so effectually that the big man fainted. However, he started
out in two days, accompanied by Jacques Leber, Charles Le Moyne and
Migeon de Branssat. At Ste. Anne's, he had busy work, with young
Forestier, a surgeon from Montreal, in attending the sick men who
suffered from famine and scurvy, while eleven died. Though himself sick
the cheery chaplain did good, self-sacrificing service, none the less
excellent, because it was seasoned with a plenteous fund of raillery
and bantering. Among the officers there was La Durantaye, famous
hereafter in Canadian annals. So the winter wore away at Ste. Anne's,
relieved by provisions sent by the good folks of Montreal.

That winter the Hôtel-Dieu of Montreal was filled to overflowing with
the sick and wounded, which it had received from the army under de
Courcelles after the terrible war of the early winter. During the next
year it continued its good work, for which Dollier de Casson says it
deserved unspeakable praise, receiving the sick from the forts of Ste.
Anne, St. Louis and St. Jean.

Before closing the narration of the events of this year we must not
forget the joy at Montreal caused by the news spread in September that
the king had settled all doubts of the rights of the Seigneurs of
Montreal by confirming the letters patent of 1644. This confirmation M.
Talon put into practice on September 17th when he received the fealty
and homage of the Seminary for the Seigneurs of Montreal "with high,
low and middle justice," and two days afterwards, in virtue of the
extraordinary powers granted him by the king, ordered the seigneurs to
be maintained in the possession of the administration of justice, thus
supplanting the royal court of the sénéchal already established, as
before mentioned.

The Seminary had right to name its own governor also, but no one was
appointed to the vacant post of Maisonneuve till 1669.

Thus the year closed in a peace to last for twenty years. The king's
arms had battered Iroquois insolence.

But the heroic age was at an end.[95]

After the successful war, de Tracy engaged himself before departing
in May for Montreal, in consolidating the paternal government lately
introduced and in conciliating the habitants on behalf of his royal
master. He came to Montreal to take cognizance of it as a place which
was most commonly resorted to by the savage as the most advanced point
on the river.

He left Quebec on May 4th, and two days later Talon, as intendant, set
out to pay his official visit to Montreal. He acquitted himself to the
satisfaction of the settlers on all the côtes "for," says Dollier de
Casson, "he went to the great edification of the public from house to
house, even to the poorest, asking if all were being treated according
to equity and justice, and when pecuniary assistance was needed, it was
forthcoming."

We shall speak later of many of the progressive movements initiated
through M. Talon at this time.

This year the Seigneurs of Montreal were given back the possession of
the storehouse at Quebec, about which there had been much contention.

The question of the "dime" had agitated Montreal as elsewhere.
Originally fixed by Laval at one-thirteenth it had been reduced to
one-twentieth and then to one-twenty-sixth. Even then in view of the
difficulties of a young country it was not payable for five years, to
allow the settler to cultivate his lands more easily. But at the same
time, it was arranged that in the future, better times might allow it
to be increased. This was regulated by an act of the clerk's office
at Montreal of August 23, 1667; but a further act of an assembly,
held on August 12, 1668, shows appreciation on the part of the syndic
and inhabitants of a desire to meet the seigneurs in the upkeep of
the church by fixing the dime at one-twenty-first part for wheat and
one-twenty-sixth for other grains.

The arrangements for the payment of the dime had been made jointly by
de Tracy, de Courcelles and Talon. De Tracy left Quebec on September
28th, to the great regret of Laval and the clergy.

[Illustration: PLAN OF MONTREAL, 1650-1672]

The census of Montreal for this year (1667) is given as 766 souls;
Three Rivers and its dependencies, 666; Côte de Beaupré, 656; Isle of
Orleans, 529; Quebec, 448; other settlements under the government of
Quebec, 1,011; Beauport, 123; Côte de Lauson (south shore), 113. In
this year there were 11,448 arpents under cultivation in New France.
There were 3,107 heads of cattle, besides 85 sheep. These latter
began to be imported in 1665, at the same time as the horses. In the
following year 15,649 arpents were cultivated and the production of
wheat amounted to 130,978 minots.

But more clergy was needed, so this year M. Souart, the curé of
Montreal, went over to France to seek new missioners for the work of
the Sulpicians. He left behind him M. Giles Pérot as curé and MM.
Galinier, Barthélemy and Trouvé. At the Hôtel-Dieu the venerable
superioress, Mother Macé, had five nuns under her direction, and at the
house of the "Congregation" Marguerite Bourgeoys, with three helpers,
continued her good work.

M. Souart brought back a most enthusiastic worker who was none other
than the redoubtable Abbé de Queylus. There was at last no opposition
on the part of Laval. The elements leading to this change of front are
twofold: firstly, the archbishop of Rouen had some time ago renounced
all pretension to jurisdiction in New France, and thus was removed
Laval's contentious attitude against de Queylus, for it was not a
question of persons with him, but of prerogatives. He had looked upon
de Queylus as the representative of a rival authority which might tend
to raise "altar against altar," and lead to schism and so destroy his
policy of church centralization. Secondly, de Queylus had received an
invitation from the king, who had been apprised of his good qualities
through the papal nuncio, Picolomini, now become a cardinal, and the
king's word went with Laval.

Accordingly, when de Queylus arrived in the spring with three
Sulpicians, M. René de Brébant de Galinée, M. François Saturnin
Lascares d'Urfé,[96] and his former secretary, M. Antoine d'Allet, Laval
received them most cordially and gave de Queylus letters patent as his
vicar general, a post held by him in Montreal during all his further
stay.

Laval has described this reception himself in a letter to his
friend, M. Poitevin, the curé of St. Fossé at Paris. Speaking of the
consolation in receiving M. de Queylus and the new workers he says:
"We have embraced them all in the name of Jesus Christ. What gives us
most sensible joy is that we see our clergy disposed, with one heart
and one soul, to procure the glory of God and the salvation of souls,
both French and Indian. The fatherly tenderness which the king has made
apparent to New France and the notable contributions he has made to
make it more numerous and flourishing, furnishes an ample harvest field
for all to employ their zeal and spend their lives for the love of
Jesus Christ, who has given them the first inspirations to consecrate
themselves to Him and His church."

This was not a diplomatic change of attitude with Laval. He was
incapable of dissimulation or subterfuge. He saw the glory of God in
the new situation and thenceforward the Sulpicians had a true friend
and admirer.

On their part the Jesuits were no less cordial in their welcome. The
"Relation" for 1668 speaks of the same powerful reinforcement of
the clergy for Montreal and hoped for much good from "these great
missionaries."

There were now about fifteen Sulpicians in Montreal when, in the month
of June, 1668, an embassy of Iroquois came from the Bay of Kenté, on
the banks of Lake Ontario, asking for a black robe to instruct their
people in the religion of the white man. Two young priests, M. Fénelon
and M. Trouvé, having offered themselves, on September 15th, Mgr.
Laval gave them letters to establish their mission, and they embarked
at Lachine on October 2d, and arrived at the Bay of Kenté (Quinté) on
October 28th. This was the first mission of the Sulpicians. Their good
work, begun at Montreal, was to stretch far and wide. If we do not
follow them in detail it is because we are sketching only the original
and cradle events of great movements in these annals. In the winter
M. de Queylus sent M. Dollier de Casson and M. Barthélemy to Lake
Nipissing.

The peace with the Iroquois left further opportunity for
self-sacrificing missioners to work among them, so that in 1669 the
clergy were glad to welcome the return of the Recollects. Not only
did Laval welcome them, but the Jesuits, who succeeded them on the
renewal of the French possession, after the occupation by the English
under Kirke, though they are represented by mischief-making historians
as having "supplanted" them, wrote as follows of their joy at their
coming, in the "Relations" of 1670:

"The Reverend Recollect Fathers, who have come from France to be a new
succour to the missionaries in the growth of this church, have given
us an excess of joy and consolation. We have received them as the
first apostles of this country, and in recognition of the obligation
due to them by the French colony, the inhabitants of Quebec have been
delighted to receive these good religious, now established on the same
ground where they dwelt forty years before the French were driven from
Canada by the English."

In fact, arrangements were made by those who had been put into
possession of the Recollects' former estates, held prior to 1629, to
cede them, and the friars now had an estate of ten by ten arpents, for
which the governor general gave them new titles by an act of October
23, 1670.

We have now to record the appointment of a new governor for Montreal,
left officially vacant since de Maisonneuve's departure, three and
a half years ago, although several commandants had represented
the Seigneurs. The choice fell upon M. Marie François Perrot, a
_gentilhomme_ by birth, and captain of an Auvergne regiment, who was
then on the point of crossing over with his regiment to establish
himself with his wife in Canada and doubtless make his fortune.

M. Perrot had married Talon's niece, Madeleine de Laguide, and it was
the former intendant, then about to revisit Canada for a second time,
who solicited the vacant post from M. de Bretonvilliers, the superior
of the Seminary of St. Sulpice in Paris who granted it by a letter
addressed to M. Perrot on June 13, 1669, being "duly informed of your
good life and character, talents, capacity and good qualities, we
have made choice of your person to fill and exercise the office of
governor ... without you at the same time being able to make pretensions
to any salary or remuneration other than the country has been accustomed
to give."

On the voyage, Perrot, his wife and Talon were shipwrecked, and they
saved their lives on a broken mast by having promised a large sum of
money to the sailors for having assisted them to it. Five hundred
emigrants came with this expedition.

But on Perrot's arrival in Montreal, where he and his wife were well
received, in pity for their shipwreck and out of interest in the
lady governor--for Maisonneuve had been a sorry bachelor--he sought
to have his commission made more certain by letters patent from
the king. Accordingly, this was finally effected through Talon and
Colbert, by letters dated March 14, 1671, and with the consent of M.
Bretonvilliers, whose rights seemed not to be infringed, since it
had been the custom for the governor generals named by the seigneur
companies, also to receive a royal commission.

So far we have kept our attention on the little straggling Village of
Montreal, the home of de Maisonneuve and the seigneurs of the island.
We have left it occasionally for Quebec, to consider it, as affected
in its governmental relations with the headquarters of the governor
general, but as we have in view also the greater Montreal of today,
we must ask the reader's patience to allow us to record some vital
elements in the suburban growth of the latter, the seeds of which are
now being sown, and to watch the origins of the Canadian "noblesse" now
being manufactured by letters patent in the neighbourhood of Montreal.

For years the fear of the Iroquois had huddled the Montrealers within
narrow limits, and in the neighbourhood of the fort. There were few
outlying stations, save that of the fortified house of Lambert Closse,
who had been given on February 5, 1658, the first "noble fief" at
Montreal, and the two redoubts or strongholds established by M. de
Queylus for the seigneurs of the seminary. On the arrival of the troops
the _curé_, M. Souart, had created a second "noble fief" for his nephew
M. Hautmesnil between the River St. Lawrence and the Rivière des
Prairies, and a third followed on the return of M. Queylus, given to La
Salle.

Peace enabled the colonists to go further afield, and in 1671 the
seigneurs determined to establish seigneurial manors for further
protection against Iroquois incursions and to place on them, for
the most part, the officers of the regiments left behind. A debt of
gratitude was first paid to Sieur Picoté de Bélestre by a concession of
land at Pointe aux Trembles, taking in Bout de l'Isle and extending to
the Rivière des Prairies.

The northern part of the island facing the Rivière des Prairies and Ile
Jésus--a dangerous spot--was chosen for two contiguous "noble fiefs" by
Dollier de Casson on December 1, 1671 and given to Phillipe de Carion
de Fresnoy, lieutenant in Lamothe's company, and Paul de Morel, ensign
in the same company.

To strengthen the position of these seigneurs, Carion and de Morel,
smaller concessions were granted nearby in the early months of 1672. On
December 26th M. Zacharie Dupuis, the commandant of the town, received
the letters patent of his seigneury of Verdun.

The southwest of the island, facing the Lake of the Two Mountains, had
yet to be guarded, and on January 19th Dollier de Casson gave a fief to
M. Sidrac de Gué, now Sieur de Boisbriant, and added "the neighbouring
island and shallows" at a given denomination, which afterwards caused a
lawsuit.

M. de Gué shortly sold his fief to Charles Le Moyne, Sieur de
Longueuil, and Jacques Leber, his brother-in-law. It passed later to
the son of the latter and became the fief of the Sieur de Senneville,
as it was then named. In April[97] following, a seigneury was given to
Charles d'Ailleboust des Musseaux, the judge. On July 30th the fief
adjoining called "Belleville" was given to the brothers Louis de Bertet
de Chailly and Gabriel de Bertet de la Joubardière. Finally a fourth,
adjoining the latter, was assigned to M. Claude Robutel de Saint André.

The vulnerable points on the Island of Montreal thus being provided
for, Talon determined to revert, as he says, "to the ancient custom
of the Romans of distributing _proedia militaria_ to the soldiers of
a subjugated country," and the large distribution of "noble fiefs"
and patents of nobility of officers and others likely to guard a
country, dates mostly from the months of October and November of the
year 1672. In order to further strengthen Montreal and the entrance
of the Richelieu River,--both principal positions for Iroquois
descents,--fiefs were given to Sieurs de Laubia, de Labadie, de Moras,
de Normanville, de Berthier, de Comporte, de Randin, de la Valterie,
M. Jean Baptiste Legardeur de Repentigny, the son of Captain de
Saint Ours, and the Sieur de Berthelot, to whom was given Ile Jésus,
originally conceded to the Jesuits but not having been cultivated, was
yielded up by them on November 7, 1672.

All the above concessions were made on the left bank of the St.
Lawrence, from Lake St. Peter to the head of the island, ascending to
the Rivière des Prairies. From the mouth of the Richelieu and ascending
up stream on the other side of the river many other concessions were
made by Talon to de Sorel, du Pas, de Chambly, Chevalier Pierre de
Saint Ours (captain of the Carignan-Sallières regiment), Antoine
Pécaudy de Contrecoeur, de Vitré, de Verchères, de Varenne, de
Grandmaison, Michel Messier, of Montreal, to whom was given the
seigneury of St. Michel, and Jacques Le Moyne, also of Montreal, that
of Cap de la Trinité; to Sidzac du Gué de Boisbriant, was given the
Ile Thérèse facing Bout de l'Isle; to M. Boucher, the Seigneur de
Boucherville, to Charles Le Moyne, two fiefs, one of which he called
Longueuil, from his place of origin at Dieppe, in Normandy, and the
other Chateauguay. To Zacharie Dupuis was given Heron Island; to M.
Perrot the island below the southwest corner of the island, afterwards
named Ile Perrot, after him, as well as Ile á la Paix, Iles aux Pins,
Ste. Geneviève and St. Gilles.

This list of names has been given, since it is synonymous with that
of many of the parishes hereafter erected in these districts, for not
many of the seigneurs were as yet wealthy, and they could not fulfill
the double condition of providing a village mill and a village church.
Though noble in name, many were as poor as church mice. Having been
granted their lands, for a nominal sum, in return for "fealty and
homage," the new noble had to work hard to clear his land within a
limited time, else he would forfeit it, for few had capital to work
it. To make his claim permanent he had to subdivide his domain to
cultivators _en censive_, or _censitaires_ who tilled the land and
paid his "cens et rente" on St. Martin's day to the seigneur, as was
common at Montreal, in the shape of half a sou and a pint of wheat for
each arpent. There were, however, restrictions such as having to grind
his corn at the seigneur's mill, when there was one, for such was an
expensive luxury. This was practically the only one of the "banalités,"
as they were called, of the French feudal system introduced into
Canada, and it was not very much of a hardship. The "corvée" still
existed, by which the seigneur could demand personal labor. In Canada
this was about six days a year and was frequently remitted, as the
seigneur found that the expense of food for the workers, etc., made it
not worth his while to use their labour.

Not all the seigneurs were as diligent and as fortunate as Charles Le
Moyne, of Montreal, who, from being the son of an innkeeper at Dieppe,
founded the noble house of Longueuil and whose son Charles, Baron
Longueuil, built a fort and a home which Frontenac said, gave an idea
of the fortified châteaux of France.

Still many of these struggling nobles, with the revenue of a peasant,
but who did sell their seigneuries, became fairly wealthy in time, and
were the nucleus of the Canadian "noblesse" and "gentilhommes" for many
a long day, though it must not be understood that all seigneurs were
also ennobled, as in France.

Some of the lazier sort, who perchance looked to the "get rich quick"
method of peltry trading, rather than the laborious toil of tilling
the earth, were soon the victims of their own circumstances; for a
few years later, in 1679, Duchesneau, the intendant, writing to the
minister in France, says: "Many of our gentilhommes, officers and
other holders of seigneuries, lead what in France is called the life
of a country gentleman and spend most of their time in hunting and
fishing. As their requirements in food and clothing are greater than
those of the simple 'habitants' and as they do not devote themselves to
improving their land, they mix themselves up in trade, run into debt
on all hands, incite their young 'habitants' to range the woods and
send their own children there to trade for furs in the Indian villages
and in the depths of the forest, in spite of the prohibition of His
Majesty. Yet, with all this, they are miserably poor."[98]

"It is pitiable," says another intendant, Champigny, in 1687, "to see
their children, of which they have great numbers, passing all summer
with nothing on them but a shirt, and their wives and daughters working
in the fields."

Later, an intendant wrote to France not to create any more
_gentilhommes_, for it meant making "beggars."

But it must be remembered that later letters of patent of nobility were
not so easily granted as at this early tentative period, when noble,
habitant, and peasant had a hard struggle with the soil to make all
ends meet.

To form an idea of the establishment of a parish, it must be remembered
that each seigneur was required to build a mill and a chapel to be
served by a priest. The mill meant a heavy expense; the machinery
had all to come from France, and the miller's wages had to be paid;
the farmers, bringing grain, small in number. Beyond the three mills
belonging to the seigneurs of the island at this period there was the
one erected at Pointe aux Trembles and that erected by Jean Milot, a
toolmaker, at a cost of 1,000 _écus_, after purchasing on November 9,
1670, La Salle's lands at Lachine, and that was finally taken over by
the seminary also, on November 2, 1673. La Salle had been required to
construct a mill, since his concession was larger than the military
fiefs of 200 arpents granted to the other petty seigneurs. To these
latter, the necessity of erecting their own mills was foregone on the
stipulation that their grain and that of their _censitaires_, should be
ground in the seminary mill.

The building of a parish church and providing a priest, both difficult
tasks in this poverty-stricken time, were delayed for some time.
The seminary meanwhile sent out its missioners to conduct services
at Lachine and Pointe aux Trembles and the surrounding district. A
temporary chapel was made in the rooms of farmers' houses as is done
in country districts in the Northwest today. It was not till November
18, 1674, that the people of Pointe aux Trembles took definite steps
for church erection, which resulted in the church of L'Enfant Jésus,
blessed by the superior of the seminary on March 13, 1678, with the
assistance of the curé of the new church and M. Jean Cavelier, brother
of La Salle and a priest of the seminary.

The feudal system, prefigured by Richelieu long ago in his commission
to the Marquis de la Roche and "following the custom of Paris,"
based on the tenure of land, was established as soon as peace was
obtained, as the best method of building up the colony and of looking
after private interests. It was a most suitable method for the time.
The feudal absolutism then created, both of church and state, were
necessary for the French at a period when they had not learned the
first elements of self-government. The pity was that this system of
leading strings was too prolonged and overdone, especially as later the
French government did not do its duty by the people, thus preventing
its progress by ruining its initiative. Had not the bolder spirits
broken through it, we should not have had the redeeming point in the
history of these times--the brilliant geographical discoveries. But
in those early wild times the military civilization now forming and
the paternal influence of the clergy at Montreal, seigneurs and parish
priests, did much for that distinctively Canadian love of discipline
and order, which is the foundation of the great and mighty people
Canada is destined to be.

Talon, writing to Colbert on November 13, 1666, says: "I have already
commenced the enfiefments by Montreal, the principal fief of this
country, in receiving its 'foi et hommage' as also its 'aveux et
dénombrements.'" A _papier terrier_, or land roll, was ordered to
be made and a list of all the lands, houses and other properties
accurately defined and registered. Uncertain titles were made clear and
others made out that had been neglected.

The condition of land tenure was not onerous; the "cens and rentes"
paid annually were not an equivalent for value received but a simple
recognition of the legal primitive right of the seigneurs, on property
given. Thus at Montreal, land sites on the portion reserved for the
future town, had been given on the annual payment of five _sous_ an
arpent, while on those in the town itself all the annual revenue
demanded was a _liard_ for each fathom.

In all the Island of Montreal the tax for each arpent of land was two
liards and a half pint of wheat. Thus the receiver of 100 arpents only
paid fifty _sous_ and fifty pints of wheat. In the first years, as the
soil was not thought to be at its full value, he was relieved of all
taxation. Sometimes, even the above slight tax was, for sufficient
reason, modified. When any farm or small holding was sold or it passed
by inheritance to collaterals, the seigneurs were entitled to "lods et
ventes," a tax of one-twelfth of the estimated value of the land. This
was usually paid within forty days of the transfer and a rebate was
generally given of one-third, but not necessarily. If the farm was sold
at a price lower than the seigneur thought proper, he had the right to
purchase it back at the estimated value on which the tax of one-twelfth
had been demanded. This system was by no means unjust. The seigneur
gained very little, for during two centuries there were many lands
which passed from father to son, or were passed on by donation without
anything accruing to the seigneur who, it must be remembered, had
practically granted the lands free to the "censitaires." It was only in
later years when the lands became of substantial value that the "lods
et rentes" gave a real source of income to them.

The feudal system worked well. Being based on land tenure, it
centralized the people and made them powerful against attack, out of
proportion to their numbers, as New England found later. It was as wise
a system for New France as the introduction into Massachusetts "of free
and common soccage."

It was wisely handled, on a more democratic basis than that of France,
and there were no real grievances. The habitants and seigneurs moved
side by side; indeed they frequently exchanged places. The class
distinctions were never thus very arbitrarily defined as in France.

Whatever we may think of the military seigneuries, that of the
Sulpicians of Montreal was very beneficial. Their rule was progressive
and zealous. Speaking of such religious seigneurs William Bennett
Munroe, Ph. D., professor of government, Harvard University, in his
chapter in Volume II of "Canada and Its Provinces, 1912," entitled
"The Seigniorial System and the Colony," says: "The priests seem to
have had faith in the colony--which was more than could be said of all
the Carignan officers who took lands from the king. This faith and
optimism the priests often communicated to the people around them, and
the results were seen in the neighbouring farms. The church in New
France never lost, as at home, its grip on the confidence of those from
whom it drew its chief strength--the rural classes. While it may seem
that the crown was lavish to a fault in satisfying its claim to landed
property, yet the church really gave the colony far more than it took
away; for, if ever there abode on this earth labours worthy of their
hire, these were the pioneer priests whose loyalty and devotion to
France appear on every page of early Canadian history. The church owed
much to the seigniorial system, but it made ample repayment." (P. 566.)

The parish life of Montreal, as that also of subsequent parishes, was
that of an organized community or civil corporation. The head was the
seigneur. One section, composed of those able to bear arms, formed the
militia with its officers.

The seigneur could appoint its judge, and if unable to provide one,
he could turn the cases arising to a neighbouring court, such as at
Montreal. In addition, there would be the _greffier_, or clerk of the
court, sergeants and the gaoler.

Municipal affairs were, at this time, managed at the "hangar," on the
common of Montreal, through the syndic who had been appointed by a
plurality of votes of the inhabitants in council, summoned thither by
church bell. At these elections the judge was present as presiding
officer, replacing the _greffier_, as mentioned in a previous chapter,
and he was accompanied by the _procureur fiscal_ and the _greffier_.
Sometimes this election, for greater formality, was made in the hall
of the seigneurs or at the château of the fort, as in the case of the
election of syndic, Louis Chevalier, on May 15, 1672.

The syndic controlled the general law and order, and when necessary,
called in the judge to his assistance, as on April 8, 1674, when the
judge fined some delinquents, on the complaint of Louis Chevalier, then
syndic, for damage done by straying cattle.

In order to surround the officers of the community with some dignity,
various ranks were assigned, so that there should be an order of
procedure in church or elsewhere, and notably in processions. In
the latter the order was as follows: the governor general, the
local governor, the officers of justice, the churchwardens. In the
processions and in other religious ceremonies the military could claim
no rank.

The _marguilliers_, or churchwardens, for their election needed an
official document drawn up by the public notary, since they were an
important body, being empowered to make contracts in the name of the
_Fabrique_, and to make acquisitions and alienations. Zacharie Dupuis,
major of the island, in 1666 is mentioned in such an act as honorary
churchwarden. Up to 1676 these officers were elected by a general
gathering, but at this date Laval ordered that the system, obtaining
at Quebec since 1660, of election by secret votes, certified by past
and present churchwardens, should be adopted in other parishes. In some
localities, besides the _marguilliers_ there was appointed a treasurer,
or receiver of gifts or of fines made applicable to the _Fabrique_
by the judge and other magistrates. According to custom, the parish
church of each place was maintained by the inhabitants, as well as the
establishment of the cemetery, and the preservation of its enclosure
from damage. On one occasion we find at Montreal that cattle had broken
into the enclosure, and the palisading had to be repaired.

No general taxation was made but it was ordered, in a general assembly,
that M. Frémont, one of the priests of the cemetery, should go
accompanied by one of the parishioners to canvass all the sections of
the parish for a subscription for the purpose. Nevertheless we find
that if the parishioners neglected their Easter duty of providing
"blessed bread" for the church or chapel, an ordinance of Quebec of
January 13, 1670, condemned them to an arbitrary fine.

As to the soldiers remaining after Tracy's departure, they had
other duties beside the peopling of the colony. According to the
feudal system incorporated by Talon, they were to take up land and
incidentally be thus, by their presence, a safeguard for others against
Iroquois attack. Montreal district, being the head and front of
Iroquois invasion, consequently welcomed these colonists, and from Lake
St. Peter to Lachine, on both sides of the St. Lawrence, fiefs were
granted large and small to officers and men. Chambly, Sorel, Saint
Ours, Contrecoeur, de Berthier, de la Valterie, Varenne, Verchères,
soldiers' names, mark military seigneuries established about this time.
Thus strong sentinel posts were, by Talon's masterly statesmanship,
gradually linked together by this band of soldiers now turned
husbandmen after the fashion prevailing since the Roman invasions of
Gaul and Britain. The holdings were near one another and were called
"côtes." We have named several of them as already existing in the
vicinity of Montreal.

The work of opening up the land was the great hope of the king. About
this time horses began to be employed, for up to July 16, 1665, they
were unknown to the Indians, and great was their astonishment to see
the twelve French "elks" that arrived that day, and the docility with
which they obeyed their masters. It was a great honour indeed to
possess one of these. Of the consignment of one stallion and twelve
mares in 1670, the following distribution was made: the stallion and
a mare to M. Chambly, two to M. Lachenaye, and one each to MM. Talon
the intendant, Saint Ours, Sorel, Contrecoeur, Varenne, Latouche,
Repentigny, La Chesnaye, and Leber. They were given with a view to
their multiplication and, indeed, of all the other animals sent, the
horses were the most prolific and successful. The conditions to be
observed were: they should be kept in condition for three years; if
any died during that time through the fault of the "donné," he should
pay the king's receiver the sum of 200 _livres_. After the expiration
of three years he might sell it and the foals, one of which he was
to keep for the king's receiver, as well as the sum of 100 _livres_.
It was further ordered that when these foals, given to the king's
receiver, had reached the third year, they were to be given to private
individuals as before on the same terms. Thus the stock breeding was
merrily continued.

Cattle were sent to New France at this period, thus: 1665, 12 mares,
2 stallions, 7 sheep; 1667, 12 mares, 2 stallions, 29 sheep; 1668, 15
horses, 44 sheep; 1669, 14 horses, 50 sheep; 1670, 13 horses; 1671,
horses and asses.

The asses sent in 1671 were distributed as follows: Sieur Marsollet,
a male ass; Sieur Neveau, a female ass; the Jesuit Fathers, one male
and one female ass; M. Dudouyt, a female; M. Damours, a female; M.
de Villieu, a female; Sieur de Longchamps, a female; Bourg Royal,
a female; Sieur Morin, a female. These did not suit the climate so
readily.[99]

The cost of these horses and sheep was great. Each mare cost 120
_livres_, each stallion, 200, the sheep, about 6 _livres_ apiece.
In 1665 the transportation and feed of the consignment cost 11,200
_livres_. By November, 1671, Talon wrote that there were enough horses.
Cows and pigs had already become as familiar as in France. It will be
remembered that in 1647 a horse was sent for M. Montmagny, the governor
general. In these early days the birch bark canoe was more useful than
the horse, for the rivers were then the only highways.

Later on Montrealers became so interested in horse rearing that,
"ignorant of their true interests," they had to be forbidden by
Intendant Raudot in 1709 to possess more than two horses or mares, and
one foal, for fear of neglecting the rearing of horned cattle.

But it must not be supposed that these seigneuries and small holdings
grew up like mushrooms. The farmer's initiation for the first two
or three years was a rough one. It was only by very patient labour,
and, little by little, that the lands were cleared, tilled, and the
modest house put up, and an assured means of easy livelihood secured.
The cultivators had to follow the same strenuous methods that those,
opening their concessions in the Northwest, employ today.

At Montreal, while there was still fear of the Iroquois, we have
seen how difficult it was to work the fields, and how, for mutual
protection, they had temporarily to till small portions of the
seigneur's domain till they could safely go farther afield. But in
1664, when it was known that the king's troops were coming, many
obtained new concessions on Côte St. Louis, some towards the mountain,
some at the foot of the current near the fortified farm of Ste. Marie.
In 1665 many resolved to go below the foot of the current and beyond
the River St. Peter, for the lands on this side of the river, and
especially those at Point St. Charles, had already been conceded, and
although abandoned during the wars, were still claimed. East and west,
the colonists now went afield to Côte St. Martin, Côte St. François
(later called Longue Pointe), Côte St. Anne, Côte St. Jean (later
called Pointe aux Trembles). At the latter place in 1669, land was
given to Jean Oury with the intention of a village church and mill,
being erected thereon.

These côtes were restricted to their river neighbourhood to guard the
settlements from Iroquois descents by the stream.

This same plan was adopted along the whole length of the St. Lawrence.
"It is pleasant to see at present," says the "Relation" of 1668,
"nearly all the banks of our River St. Lawrence peopled with new
colonies, with new villages rising, which facilitate navigation and
render the journey, more agreeable by the sight of the houses, and more
convenient by the frequent resting places offered."

All were not as diligent as could be desired in putting up within the
year stipulated hearth and home (_feu et lieu_), or in clearing their
concessions. Consequently when Talon was in Montreal in May, 1670, in
consequence of just complaints he ordered that in future no copyholder
should be granted land unless, in addition to building his homestead,
he should put two arpents under cultivation yearly under penalty of
forfeiting his grant, unless he could prove illness or other strong
cause restraining him. Moreover, in the new contract, it was to be
stipulated that no one could claim title to his land until he had put
up his buildings and had placed two arpents in cultivation, with a
pickaxe, for up to this, as seen by the concessions preserved in the
archives up to 1657, a man had been thought to have tilled his ground
if he had felled the trees and had uprooted all the roots which were a
foot in diameter or upwards, and had used the others in such a way that
a cart could pass along without obstacle.

Yet there were still difficulties, for on January 12, 1675, the
Seigneurs put up the following public notice at the parish church, the
fort, and the different mills:

"We have learned from many complaints, that several of our tenants
take no trouble, not only to establish their homes on their lands and
to put them to use, but even neglect to fell the timber, or to keep in
order the little space they have cleared on taking possession. This
negligence retards the advancement of the colony and prevents many
strangers coming to take up land in this island and to dwell here. It
causes a dearth of wheat and grain from which the people have suffered
during the past two years. Finally it entirely ruins the adjoining
lands already tilled, both because of the continued shadows which the
standing woods cast on them, and because the squirrels and other small
animals left on these uncultivated lands leave them to eat and destroy
the greater part of the grain to the ruin of other lands."

To remedy this the seigneurs gave their tenants four months to put
their lands in order and to cut down all standing timber on pain of
forfeiture to the seigneurial domain.

Even in cutting down the timber there were abuses at Montreal. To
provide against the carelessness of riverside cultivators, as all were
at this time, in dumping their lumber into the river, Talon issued the
following order in October, 1670: "Whereas it has been pointed out to
us that the inhabitants of Montreal between Ste. Marie and La Petite
Chine (Lachine) have cut their timber so that, having fallen into the
river, it prevents navigation and blocks communication, we order them
to cut their wood into logs and to place them on the stream in such a
way that they may be carried away with the ice when it melts this year."

These logs could then be sold at Quebec in return for the necessities
of life.

The history of the first public roads and bridges at Montreal now
begins as the outcome of all this clearing and passing of carts to and
fro. In the _procès verbal_ of the road from Pointe aux Trembles to
the stream, Jean des Roches gives us an insight into the formalities
usually pursued. When the habitants had asked for a road, the Seigneurs
or their representatives would meet them at the place indicated, when
the projected road was traced and landmarks placed at intervals stamped
with the lead seal of the Seigneurs. After the new road was clearly
defined, a statement was drawn up, and then each proprietor set to work
to clear the road space running through his property; if a bridge was
necessary, one of logs was constructed; if a stream had to be crossed,
being common property, all contributed to the construction of this as
a public work. Thus the first bridge was thrown over the St. Pierre by
order of M. Talon, dated October 24, 1670.

Several roads had already been partially made, e. g., from the redoubt
of L'Enfant Jésus to Petit Lac (or the marsh which is now occupied
by Place Viger and a part of St. Denis and Craig Streets); from the
Coteau St. Louis to that of Ste. Marie; and provisional roads were
made through the woods on either side of the River St. Pierre, and the
marshy roads made practicable by log foundations or log bridges.

All these roads were eighteen feet broad, with the exception of the
road bordering the River St. Lawrence, which Talon fixed at twenty
feet; but the Seigneurs raised it to thirty-six feet seeing that it
was used as a towing path for the horses drawing the bateaux between
the currents and the rapids, and as it was the principal means of
communication and circulation between the lower and higher parts of
the island, they ordered the riverside owners to keep it in order.
To indemnify them for the loss of this extra space, other land was
added to the other extremity of their concessions. As most of these
improvements took place under Intendant Talon, Abbé de Queylus and
Dollier de Casson, city planners may know to whom honour is due.

CHAPTER XIX

1666-1672

ECONOMICAL PROGRESS

INDUSTRIES, TRADE AND LABOUR

     COMMERCE--MINING--SHIP BUILDING--INDUSTRIES--A "MUNICIPAL"
     BREWERY--THE FIRST MARKET--PRICES--LABOUR--MEDICAL MEN


Farming is the backbone of a nation's prosperity. Hence Louis XIV,
through Colbert and Talon, made this as we have seen their first
solicitude. Commerce comes next, and in May, 1664, the king gave
letters patent to the Company of the Western Indies, which should equip
vessels to trade with the French colonies, giving it the exclusive
right of trading with America. He gave it extensive backing, but in
spite of his sacrifices he had to suppress it in 1674, ten years after
its formation. It was accused of abuses of power, like the preceding
monopolies.

Talon turned his attention to the exploitation of mines, which might
give many an occupation. In the month of October, 1669, Mère de
l'Incarnation writes: "They have discovered a fine lead or tin mine
forty leagues beyond Montreal, with a slate quarry and a coal mine.
Copper mines were also discovered near Lake Superior."

In 1672 the first ship built in Canadian waters was launched. Its
capacity was four to five hundred tons. Previously Canadian wood had
been sent to France for the royal dockyards. Perhaps some of the
Montreal oaks that had been sent floating down stream to Quebec found a
destination in the wooden walls of France.

General industries were favoured by the king, and Talon was told
to spare no effort in opening out its various branches. Soon the
enterprising intendant was accredited by Marie l'Incarnation and the
historians of the "Relations" with initiating hemp, cloth, serge,
soap, woolen, tanning, shoe, pots and brewing industries. The latter
was especially encouraged as an offset against the dangerous evil
dimensions of the strong liquor traffic in Canada.

The records of the city archives for June 23, 1672, give the details
of a general assembly of the principal representatives of Montreal to
build a large brewery to supplant that already in existence, and now
found by experience, after the advent of the soldiers to be too small
for the needs of the growing community. The money for this apparently
municipal venture was borrowed from the Gentlemen of the Seminary, the
only bankers of the time. Two water mills now began to be constructed,
since with the advent of the soldiers, the old windmill at the fort and
that of the "Côteau" no longer sufficed.

The manufacture of homespun materials was encouraged by Talon, but
as yet it did not make much headway. Still Talon, writing in 1671
to Colbert, could report that he had caused drugget, coarse camlet,
étamine, serge, woolen cloth and leather to be manufactured in Canada,
adding: "I have, of Canadian make, the wherewithal to clothe myself
from head to foot."

The first market place was opened in 1676 opposite the seigneurial
manor house, which was established on St. Paul Street, and its site
was the land now occupied today by the Inland Revenue and that running
down to the river. Up to its opening, all sales had been conducted in
private houses. The market was held every Tuesday and Friday from 8
o'clock A. M. in summer and 9 A. M. in winter to 11 o'clock A. M., and
as there was no public clock then in the city the hour of commencing
and closing were sounded by the parish church bell.

Some market prices of the period may be cited. M. Boucher, in his
"Natural History of New France," written about 1663, says that a minot
of wheat (French measure, 39 litres) cost 20 sous and sometimes 6
francs. After the arrival of the troops it sold for no more than 3
_livres_. In 1669, creditors were bound to receive the wheat of their
debtors at 4 _livres_ the minot. Under M. d'Argenson a barrel of 500
eels was sold for 25 to 30 francs. A hundred planks, 10 feet long,
10 inches broad and 1 inch thick, were worth 50 _livres_. Butter was
sold at 12 to 16 sous a pound. An ox of seven to eight years, good for
slaughter, went for 200 _livres_; an ordinary sow, 30 _livres_; a pig,
good for killing, from 45 to 50 _livres_.

The day's work of a mason, a carpenter and a joiner was paid at the
rate of 40 sous; that of a good manual labourer, 30 sous. Hired
servants, after their time of service was completed, obtained 30 to
45 écus yearly, although their board cost their masters 200 _livres_,
and in bad times 300. In 1663, day labourers, when boarded, were paid
in winter at the rate of 2 sous and 30 in the summer. But after the
arrival of the soldiers and the increase of population, prices were
raised accordingly. By a judgment of the court of Montreal in 1667 the
daily wage of manual labourers was valued at 40 sous and of artisans at
3 _livres_.

The master and apprentice system was not in vogue in Canada in these
days, and everyone could set up for himself. Let us hope it was not
so with the doctors, of whom there were from July 8, 1669, to the end
of the following year, at least five, practicing in Montreal: Etienne
Bouchard and Forestier, partners; René Sauvageau de Maisonneuve and
Jean Rouxelle de la Rousillière, partners; and Jean Martinet de
Fontblanche. The latter, later, had an "apprentice," for in the act of
January 15, 1674, by Notary Basset, we find him promising to teach his
brother-in-law, Paul Prud'homme, in the three years and a half with
him, his art of surgeon and everything connected with that profession.
In these days the first health officers of Canada were surgeons,
pharmacists, doctors, dentists, apothecaries, all in one. They were
officially mentioned as "surgeons" probably because the art of surgery
in the time of hostility with the Iroquois was more in demand than that
of any other department of medicine.

Montreal was a small enough place to support five medical men,
especially as the treatment at the Hôtel-Dieu was gratuitous. In 1669,
in the month of August, the letters patent confirming this body as a
permanent and authorized corporation were granted.




CHAPTER XX

1666-1672

COLONIZATION AND POPULATION

     ENCOURAGEMENT OF MARRIAGE--BACHELORS TAXED--"FILLES DU
     ROI"--DOWRIES--PENSIONS FOR LARGE FAMILIES--MONTREAL HEALTHY FOR
     WOMEN--NOTE ON IMMIGRATION.


One of the outstanding failures in New France so far had been that
of inadequate attempts to increase the number of colonists. This the
king was now anxious to remedy. To this end, when the war was over,
through the efforts of Colbert and Talon and before Tracy had left with
his glittering train, he offered inducements to the Carignan soldiers
to remain as colonists and to take up land. To each such concessions
of land were granted with a bonus of 100 _livres_, or fifty _livres_
and provisions for one year. The sergeants would receive a year's
provisions and one hundred to one hundred and fifty _livres_. Thus 400
of the Carignan regiment remained to swell the population.

To increase this number six infantry companies of fifty-three men each
were sent back in 1669. To each of the six captains he gave a bonus of
1,000 _livres_, with another 6,000 to be divided among the lieutenants
and ensigns. This military colonization largely influenced the future
of Canada.

To encourage permanent settlement efforts were now redoubled to provide
wives for the men. In 1665, 100 girls were sent over. In 1666, twice as
many; in 1667, and 1668, still more; in 1669, 150 and the same in 1670.
An ordinance published in Montreal November 30, 1670, shows the efforts
of the government to promote match-making--all _volontaires_ and others
not married being forbidden the privilege of hunting, fishing and
trading with the savages[100] and even of entering the bush under any
pretext whatever, the latter prohibition probably being intended to
prevent a bachelor finding a temporary Indian substitute for a French
wife. Bachelors had a hard time. Colbert, writing to Talon on February
20, 1668, says: "It will be appropriate that those, who seem to have
renounced wedlock, shall have to bear additional charges and to be
deprived of all honours and even to have some marks of infamy added to
them."

To press the execution of these commands, all those soldiers and
unattached workers not having taken up land, were ordered to marry
within fifteen days of the arrival of the ships bearing the girls.
Thus, Marie de l'Incarnation tells us, in 1669, that no sooner are the
vessels arrived than the young men go wife hunting, and marriages are
celebrated thirty at a time.

Among the children of those already settled, early marriages were
encouraged. "I pray you," wrote Colbert to Talon on February 20, 1668,
"to command it to the consideration of the whole people that their
property, their subsistence, and all that is dear to them, depend on
a general resolution, never to be departed from, to marry youths at
eighteen or nineteen years, and girls at fourteen or fifteen; since
abundance can never come to them except through the abundance of men."
And for this purpose the "king's present" of twenty _livres_ to each
of the contracting parties was given. Fathers of families, according
to the decrees of the state council of this period, who did not marry
their boys and girls when they had reached the ages of twenty-one and
sixteen were fined, and following this up, they had to appear every six
months after before the clerk of the court to give reason for further
delays under penalty of fines to be made applicable to the hospitals.

We have already given indication of the extreme care that had been
exercised at Montreal in the reception of such prospective mothers of
the colony; how Marguerite Bourgeoys had herself brought over on her
different voyages girls of noted virtue, whom she trained to become
good housewives, and for many she found eligible partners in life.

At Quebec a similar work was carried on, by a Madame Bourdon, with
motherly skill and devotion. If she was not as successful as Marguerite
Bourgeoys this was not surprising, since the latter was singularly
endowed by nature for such a task.

These girls were chaperoned, across the ocean, by the nuns or pious
persons, or by Madame Bourdon herself, and then placed under her charge
until marriage. We find an item of expense for 1671 paid by the king to
a Demoiselle Etienne for the care she had taken in taking girls from
the general hospital to Canada and in looking after them till they were
married. These were received by Madame Bourdon.

Human nature, being very much the same then as now, we can imagine that
some of these girls, drawn from the orphanages of Paris and Lyons, and
carefully trained by the nuns, were rude and difficult to handle, but
on the whole the venture was a great success. There was, of course,
as Marie de l'Incarnation says, in 1668, "mixed goods," and in 1689,
"along with honest people a great deal of 'canaille,' of both sexes who
cause a great deal of scandal."

But such care was taken from the very beginning of colonization,
since New France was viewed in the nature of a mission field, only to
send persons of good repute and to deport undesirables, that French
Canadians have no need to blush at their parentage. The families
descending from the Carignan soldiers may point with pride to their
origins. A caustic writer, La Hontan, writing twenty years after, by
his amusing, witty, and scurrilous descriptions of the matrimonial
market of this period, has done much to slander these early marriages,
but he is discredited, and his version is regarded as a caricature and
maliciously untrue, as Parkman points out.

These girls were called "les filles du roi," since they were maintained
at the charge of the king's bounty in the philanthropic orphanages of
France. At Montreal, under Marguerite Bourgeoys, they were lodged
with her in a house bought by Saint Ange, since the old stable was too
small. There, they were carefully instructed in religion and practical
affairs to become good mothers of families, and they did not leave her
till the day of their marriages. At this time, a pious congregation
of lay women was formed by Marguerite Bourgeoys; these met on Sundays
for the practice of virtue and many of the newly arrived girls were
kept in touch with the gentle and motherly Marguerite, long after
their marriages. It was from this date that her home began to be
affectionately spoken of as "The Congregation."

In addition to girls of a humble class, _demoiselles_ of a more
superior station were also encouraged to come to provide wives for the
officers and others, of whom Colbert wished to form the nucleus of
a Canadian _noblesse_. Several others, who first thought of passing
through the noviceship at the Hôtel-Dieu and joining the Hospitalières
Sisters, found their vocation otherwise, like Perrine de Bélestre,
sister of Picoté, who married Michel Godefroy, Sieur de Linlot, at
Three Rivers.

When the king's daughters married, they were given the king's dowry,
varying in form and value. Sometimes it was a house with provisions for
eight months, more often, fifty _livres_ in household supplies, besides
a barrel or two of salted meat.[101] And when they were married they
were encouraged to rear up a fruitful progeny, for in the "Edits et
Ordonnances" of the Province of Quebec, p. 67, a decree is found that
"in future all inhabitants of the said country of Canada, who shall
have living children to the number of ten, born in lawful wedlock, not
being priests, monks or nuns, shall each be paid out of the moneys
sent by His Majesty to the said country a _pension_ of 300 _livres_
a year, and those who shall have twelve children a pension of 400
_livres_; and that to this effect they shall be required to declare the
number of their children every year, in the months of June or July,
to the intendant of justice, police and finance, established in the
same country, who having verified the same, shall order the payment of
the said pensions, one-half in cash, and the other half at the end of
eight years." Furthermore, he ordered that fathers of large families
should have preference over others unless there was strong contrary
reason. The decreasing birth rate in France at that period prompted
such regulations in New France. The king's activity through Colbert in
peopling his colony is seen in numerous letters to his officials. In an
instruction to the Intendant Bouteroue in 1668 Colbert writes: "The end
and rule of all your conduct should be the increase of the colony; and
on this point I should never be satisfied, but labour without ceasing
to find every imaginable expedient for preserving the inhabitants,
attracting new ones and multiplying marriages."

These encouragements bore fruit. Laval, writing in 1668, says: "The
families of our French people in this country are very numerous; for
the most part they consist of eight, ten, twelve, and sometimes as many
as fifteen or sixteen children. The savages, on the contrary, have only
two or three and rarely do they go beyond four."

The Abbé de Queylus, now superior of the seminary at Montreal, wrote
to Colbert on May 15, 1669, that owing to the efforts of the king "the
number of the inhabitants of New France has increased two-thirds."

The population propaganda at Montreal was left largely to the seigneurs
of the seminary. In 1666, there were 582 persons; in 1667, there were
766; in 1672, the population was doubled to 1,500 or 1,600 souls, as
Dollier de Casson relates in his account of this year, which is the
concluding chapter of his "History of Montreal."

We may fitly conclude this chapter by giving two of the worthy
Dollier's reflections:

"First reflection, on the advantage that the women have in this
place (Montreal) over men, which is, that although the cold climate
is very healthy for the one and the other sex, it is incomparably
to the advantage of the feminine, which finds itself here almost
immortal--this is what everyone says since the birth of this settlement
and what I myself have remarked for six years, for although there are
fourteen to fifteen thousand souls here, there has only been the death
of one woman for the last six years."

"The second reflection will be on the facility which people of this
sex have of marrying here, a fact which is apparently clear to all the
world since it is practiced every year, but which is admirably shown by
an example I am going to tell you of one _qui sera assez rare_. It is
of a woman who, having this year lost her husband, has had one of the
bans published, and being dispensed of the two others had her marriage
performed and consummated before her first husband was buried. These
two reflections in my opinion will be sufficiently strong to thin out
the _Hôpital de la Pitié_ and to secure a good party of girls from all
the Paris orphanages if only they are desirous, to live long, or to
cultivate a devotion to the seventh of our sacraments."


NOTE

IMMIGRATION--1665-1670

The Compagnie des Indes Occidentales, which had been granted the domain
of New France from May 16, 1664, one year after the forced retirement
of the Hundred Associates, brought over on the king's account, in
1665,[3] 429 men and 100 women and girls; in 1667,[3] 184 men and 92
women and girls; and in 1668,[102] 244 of both sexes.

In addition, during the above period 422 officers and soldiers of
Carignan regiment were established in the colony. In 1666 the company
sent out on its own account 35 hired men (engagés); in 1669,[4] 200 men
and 150 women; in 1670,[4] 100 men and 100 women; in 1671,[103] 100 men
and 150 women; in 1672, the war in Holland stopped the movement.

In 1670 there came five companies of fifty men each, making with their
officers an effective force of 266. Thus for the first period we have
sent at the king's account about one thousand four hundred persons,
and for the second 1,116 about two thousand five hundred and sixteen
in all. But there was a certain number of others who came to find
a position, or were brought over by the owners of fiefs or by the
seigneurs of Montreal.

Talon encouraged marriages so that with the establishments of the
officers and the soldiers, joined to the activity of the emigration
movement from 1665 to 1668, the families had more than doubled their
numbers, and the population was also almost doubled during this period.

In 1665 the first census under Talon shows, at the commencement of
1666, 3,215 souls and 533 families; at the commencement of 1668, 6,282
souls and 1,132 families.

Yet the official report of Frontenac in 1673 after the departure of
Talon gave only a population of 6,705. This seems incredible and
Colbert expressed surprise. From 1669 to 1672 the king had sent over
820 persons without counting the soldiers arriving in 1670. Add to
this the material increase, the six to seven hundred births of 1671
and those of 1672, estimated in advance by Laval at 1,100, and it
is difficult to admit that the population had only increased by 423
souls from 1668 to 1673. The census of 1675 gives 7,833. This is more
reasonable and leads to the conclusion that the returns of 1673 were
too small.

The population of Montreal, according to Morin "Le Vieux Montreal," was
as follows: 1642, 72; 1650, 196; 1660, 472; 1665, 525; 1667, 760; 1662,
830; 1680, 1,400; 1690, 1,567; 1700, 2,100; 1710, 3,492; 1720, 5,314;
1730, 6,351; 1740, 7,710; 1750, 8,224; 1760, 8,321.

One of the feudal villages rising at this period was that now known
as Lachine. Its original name was St. Sulpice. It was granted
provisionally in 1667 as a fief to René Robert Cavelier de La Salle, a
brother of M. Jean Cavelier, a young doctor in theology and a Sulpician
who had joined the seminary at Montreal on September 7, 1666.

[Illustration: RENE-ROBERT CAVELIER DE LA SALLE]

La Salle, as the former is known to us, became afterwards the
celebrated discoverer of the Mississippi down to the sea and as a
Montrealer deserves special notice here.

He was born at Rouen, November 21, 1643, and was educated at the Jesuit
College there. In his fifteenth year he entered the Jesuit noviceship,
on October 5, 1658. During the two years of noviceship, the père
maître, or novice master, had a difficult task to train the impetuous,
vigorous, impressionable, headstrong, exuberant, healthy youth of
fifteen, to the calm regularity of obedience, and the soldierly,
intellectual routine demanded by the Jesuit traditions; but it is just
this type of strong character, so powerful for good, if brought under
wise subjection, that the Jesuits love to mould; and so the young man
was allowed to take the simple vows of Evangelical Poverty, Chastity
and Obedience on October 10, 1660. The next two years he spent as a
Jesuit scholastic at the Royal College of La Flèche studying philosophy
and the physical sciences, showing ability in the latter courses.
Instead of finishing the third year, the restless young man went out
to teach as a Jesuit professor at Alençon for a year. He then resumed
his delayed third year. From October, 1664, to October, 1665, he taught
at Tours, and from 1665 to 1668 at Blois. In the September of 1666 he
returned to La Flèche to study theology. He was then only twenty-three
years of age, and had been promoted to the theology course seven or
eight years ahead of the usual Jesuit course, because his inability
to stay long in any one place and his want of success in a humdrum
professorship for which he had no taste, and which was irritating
to him and his students, forced his superiors to allow him to hurry
through his studies, thinking doubtless that this ardent spirit might
find congenial work in the distant mission fields with every facility
for exercising his fiery zeal, with less restraint, and under less
conventional circumstances than in France.

This resolution was brought about by Cavelier's own insistency in
demanding immediately the foreign missions, in a letter of April 5th,
written from Blois, to the general of the Jesuits, Jean Paul Oliva.
The general on May 4, 1666, answered temporizingly to the young man,
advising him to continue his studies and prepare himself usefully for
the sacred ministry, and in the meantime maintain that most "perfect
indifference," which is one of the most striking characteristics of
the Jesuit philosophical training and has been subjected to so much
criticism of praise or blame. To this Cavelier replied that he had
still the same desire, but the general wrote that he could give no
different reply. To understand Cavelier's nature he is described in the
Jesuit informations of the time as "inquietus" and "scrupulosus," which
words are very nearly English. Hardly had the theological studies at
La Flèche commenced than he wrote to the general, on December 1, 1666,
asking to be sent to Portugal for his studies. No doubt the restless
Cavelier was undergoing a nervous strain of scrupulosity and doubt as
to his fitness for religious and priestly life, and he thought that
he could find peace of mind again in a change of scene. The general
replied kindly, bidding him remain quietly in his own "Province,"
to conclude his studies, and after the third year of probational
novitiate, which all Jesuits undergo after being ordained and before
taking their final "solemn" vows, his zealous desire for the foreign
missions would be satisfied.

This answer brought to a head Cavelier's doubts as to his fitness
for the calmer repose of a studious life. On the one hand there were
holding him his three simple vows, not lightly to be laid down, and to
which he had been doubtless substantially faithful; on the other, he
felt that his natural character was impelling him to a freer life than
that of restrained self-sacrifice he had honourably tried to follow
up. So that making use of the privilege of a Jesuit scholastic, not
irrevocably bound to the Society till the taking of the last vows,
and after laying his conscience open to his superior and not "hiding
his moral infirmities," and probably exaggerating them, he applied,
canonically, for his letters of release. By January 28th, in the year
following, the final application was sent to Rome by the Jesuit rector
of La Flèche, and on March 1st, the general, Jean Paul Oliva, wrote
to the Jesuit provincial of France: "After a serious examination of
the informations which you have sent us, we authorize you to accept
the resignation of Robert Ignatius Cavelier, approved scholastic."
Ignatius was a name taken by Cavelier on taking his simple vows in 1660
in admiration of Ignatius Loyola, the soldier saint and founder of the
Society of Jesus.

Robert Ignatius Cavelier left the College of La Flèche on March 28,
1667, an ex-Jesuit. Before his final letters of freedom were given him
he received a kind letter from the general, in which he was told that
the French provincial had been instructed by him "to absolve you from
your vows and set you free." He added in Latin, "But do you, dearest
brother, wheresoever and in whatever state you shall find yourself, be
ever mindful of the state from which you have gone forth, and attend
to the rock from which you have been hewed, and although you may be
separated from us in time and place, strive always to be in heart with
us and to live in Christ with us. May His grace be always with you!"
(Archives General S. J.) Cf. Rochemonteix "Les Jésuites et la Nouvelle
France."

Circumstances in later life separated him largely from intercourse
with the Jesuits, as his career took him across the Sulpicians and the
Recollects.

Cavelier de La Salle is free! Where will he turn his steps? He has no
position and very little of a fortune, for on becoming a Jesuit he had
yielded up his inheritance to others of his family. Canada calls him,
for his brother François, the priest, had gone there in the September
of 1666. Canada, therefore, had doubtless been luring him during his
late mental struggles at La Flèche, and the summer of 1667 found the
ex-Jesuit with his brother, the Sulpician, at Montreal.

The Abbé de Queylus received the young man of twenty-four years kindly,
and doubtless for his brother's sake gave him a "_fief noble_" of great
extent opposite the Sault St. Louis. To encourage him to make good, the
title was not given in writing to him till January 9, 1669, when he
paid a medal of fine gold, which was to be repaid to the Seminary at
every subsequent change of seigneur.

The adventurous Sieur de La Salle set whole-heartedly to work in his
new vocation. He gratefully called the seigneury "St. Sulpice" and,
commencing the clearing of the land, he mapped out the borders of his
future village and subdivided his land as grants to his feudal tenants
in lots of sixty arpents, with half an arpent in the village itself.
He relieved them of any seigneurial dues till the year 1671, provided
they had built their homes by the feast of St. John, 1669. He gave
them the right of hunting on their lands and of fishing in front. He
took off 200 arpents of land from his fief towards Lake St. Peter for
a "common," whereon each could feed his beasts at a feudal fine of
five sous a year, while he reserved 400 arpents for his seigneurial
manor. This, however, he sold in 1670, when the passion for travel and
discovery seized him, as shall be later described.

We have ventured to give the romantic details of the history of one of
the early seigneurs because they illustrate the adventuresome period
and also because many of these facts surrounding the life of La Salle
were not generally known, even by many of the leading historians
of Canada. They will help as a key to explain the temperament and
character of the celebrated discoverer, in his Canadian life, his
enterprises and his misfortunes, his extreme need of movement, his
uncertainty, his passion for travel, his reputation for learning, and
also his active and ardent faith deepened by his Jesuit training.

His robust health and his commanding figure were of powerful avail
to him in his adventurous tasks. The generous blood of Normandy
flowed freely in his veins and, like his countrymen, he was active,
intelligent, industrious, resourceful and self-regarding. He made a
better pioneer than a patient, plodding land owner, as we shall see,
and the defects of an untractable youth made the success of the man as
an explorer.

We left the young La Salle organizing his seigneury, but before long
he is to be found, gun on his shoulder and knapsack on his back,
traversing the woods and in his canoe exploring all the rivers and
lakes around the neighbourhood. Trading his merchandise for beaver
skins with the Indians and coming in contact with the _coureurs de
bois_, he learns the directions of the rivers and the products of the
countries through which they pass, and soon there seizes him the great
desire to discover the long-sought-for northwest passage to China and
Japan and thus to open out a fruitful field for commerce for France,
and glory and fortune for himself.

During the autumn of 1668 some Seneca (Tsonnontouan) Indians stopped at
St. Sulpice and from them he learned that the river he called the Ohio
entered into the Mississippi, which emptied its waters into the "River
of the Sault," which he thought to be the Pacific.[104] With the aid of
these he started to master the Iroquois language.

Meanwhile, a similar idea of exploring and evangelizing the Shawnee
district had presented itself to Dollier de Casson who was now at
Quebec, making arrangements with M. de Queylus for his departure.

Dollier had spent the winter of 1668 in the woods with the Indians at
Lake Nipissing, learning an Algonquin dialect from a Nipissing chief
named Nitaukyk. This latter had a Shawnee slave who, on a visit to
Montreal, so enthused Queylus, that he sent a letter back by the slave,
telling M. de Casson of his desire to convert the Shawnee people who
seemed to provide special aptitude for Christianity, and offering this
mission to the zealous Dollier, who hastened to his superior at once
and thence to Quebec.

To raise the money for La Salle's expedition the seigneurs bought back
a great part of his land for 1,000 _livres_, payable in merchandise
to arrive by the vessels at Quebec. But he still wished to retain his
seigneurial domain of 400 arpents. Indeed on January 11th he received
the written titles of these from the seminary.

But on February 9th, following, La Salle, still in need of funds,
sold his seigneurial domain for 2,800 _livres_ to Jean Milot--a very
good bargain considering that he had been granted it for very little,
and that the documents of the transaction reveal that he had only
cleared nine or ten arpents; and that, on the other part, the wood
had only been felled, and not logged, and buildings had only been
commenced.[105] Then he set out to Quebec to interest M. de Courcelles,
the governor, in his project and to obtain all the necessary passports
and authorizations to range the woods and lakes.

De Courcelles warmly approved of his enthusiasm, seeing glory for his
own administration at no cost to himself, and he even allowed soldiers
to quit their companies and join La Salle. He also persuaded Dollier de
Casson, then in Quebec, consulting de Queylus on the Shawnee mission,
to combine with La Salle's expedition, thus giving it a certain
governmental éclat and public importance. Dollier de Casson received
his letters from Laval on May 15, 1669. On returning to Montreal,
preparations were made for departure. La Salle engaged four canoes and
fourteen men, among whom was the Sieur Thoulonnier and the surgeon,
La Roussillière. To meet additional expenses he had to sell another
piece of land above St. Sulpice to Jacques Leber, for 600 _livres_
_tournois_, on July 6, 1669, the day of departure.

De Casson had three canoes and seven men, and with them M. de Galinée,
a Sulpician deacon, an astronomer and mathematician, who joined only
three days before the departure. They took a Hollander to interpret the
Iroquois language.

Before leaving Montreal the party witnessed the execution of three
French soldiers of the Carignan Regiment, who were put to death for
the assassination, near Point Claire on Lake St. Louis, of an Iroquois
chief of the Senecas (Tsonnontouans). On the eve of this date it was
found out, by a confession to La Salle, that three other Frenchmen had
committed, near Montreal, on the River Mascouche, a more atrocious
assassination of six Oneida Iroquois (Onneiouts), three of whom
were a woman and two children. Yet the bodies were never found, so
this remains a mystery. Rewards were offered for the capture of the
prisoners, but they were never taken. Both of these horrible slaughters
had been caused by a desire of seizing the peltry belonging to the
Indians. Such treachery was likely to rekindle war with the natives. On
this occasion, therefore, M. de Courcelles came up to conciliate the
assembled Indians and to assure them, by presents, of the governmental
displeasure at these acts. Under these critical and dangerous
circumstances, the expedition of seven canoes containing twenty-two
Frenchmen and guided by two other canoes of those Tsonnontouans who had
lived with La Salle, left Montreal.

They made their way to the great village of Tsonnontouan and stayed
there a month, trembling in fear of their lives, for the chief, lately
murdered at Montreal, came from this place. Added to this one of
those drunken bouts, the results of the liquor traffic, seized the
inhabitants and threatened the Europeans' safety. While here Dollier
de Casson, worn out by the unaccustomed hardships of the journey,
fell into a great fever and was near his end, but happily recovering,
the explorers left and arrived at a river whose cataracts marked the
descent of the waters of Lake Erie into those of Lake Ontario.

Five days' journey brought them to the other side of Lake Ontario.
While here a fever also fell upon La Salle which in a few days
imperilled his life. On September 22d, they journeyed again and on the
24th reached a village named Tenaoutoua, where they met the explorer,
Joliet, arrived there the evening before. He had previously set out
from Montreal with canoes and merchandise, under instructions from
M. de Courcelles, to seek the whereabouts of a copper mine said to
be situated on Lake Superior. Finding the winter coming on, he had
relinquished this project and was about to return to Montreal. He gave
a description of the places he had visited and Galinée, the Sulpician
geographer, entered them on his map.

La Salle now determined that he also would return to Montreal, urging
for excuse the state of his health and the inexperience of his men
to stand a winter in the woods, where they were likely to perish of
hunger. But the missionary party was firm in its resolution to proceed
to the Mississippi Indians. Thus it was that some of La Salle's party
arrived the autumn of 1669 in Montreal alone. Whether La Salle returned
with them is doubted, for his traces for two years are hard to follow.
The failure of his expedition to discover La Chine was commemorated in
derision by the wags of Montreal who henceforth dubbed his seigneury
of St. Sulpice, as that of "La Chine." Such it soon began to be named,
even in the official documents, as for example one of June 10, 1670,
"this place La Chine, so called." So La Chine it has remained to this
day.

Meanwhile the Montreal missionaries, after leaving Tenaoutoua on
October 1, 1669, arrived, the 13th or 14th, on the banks of Lake
Erie, which seemed to them like a great sea lashed and tossed by the
tempestuous winds. At the mouth of a pleasant river, after three days
they built their cabin and there they remained for fifteen days, till
the fierce lake winds drove them to a more sheltered place in the
woods, about a quarter of a league away, on a bank of a stream. There
they reconstructed their cabin, but more strongly, and wintered for
five months and eleven days.

When spring came, they determined to push on to the Mississippi
Indians, but before doing so, an event is to be chronicled in the
history of discovery, from Montreal. On March 23d, on Passion Sunday,
descending to the banks of Lake Erie, the explorers took possession of
the country in the name of Louis XIV.

The following _procès verbal_, then drawn up and preserved in the
marine archives of France, fully explains the picturesque ceremony:

"We, the undersigned, certify having affixed the arms of the king of
France, on the lands of the lake named Erie, with this inscription:

"In the year of salvation 1669, Clement IX being seated on the chair
of St. Peter, Louis XIV reigning in France, M. de Courcelles being
governor of New France and M. Talon intendant there for the king,
two missionaries of the Seminary of Montreal, arrived at this spot
accompanied by seven other Frenchmen, who are the first Europeans to
have wintered on this lake, the lands of which being unoccupied, they
take possession of in the name of their king, by placing up his arms
which they have affixed to this cross.

"In testimony of which we have signed the present certification.

      "François Dollier,
  "Priest of the Diocese of Nantes, in Brittany;

      "De Galinée,
  "Deacon of the Diocese of Rennes, in Brittany."

On the 26th of March they proceeded further on their journey, but in
Easter week, having halted by the side of Lake Erie, and drawn some
of their canoes onto the land, leaving others on the sandy shore near
the water's edge, wearied out with fatigue after a day's journey of
twenty leagues, the party fell asleep. A great wind arose and heaped
up the waters so that the awakened sleepers had difficulty in rescuing
their canoes. One they utterly lost, as well as apparel and chapel
accoutrements. A barrel of gunpowder floating on the waves was saved
but the ammunition was lost. This disaster made them resolve to turn
back to Montreal.

They chose for their return voyage the route passing by the mission of
Sault Ste. Marie. On their way, after 100 leagues' navigation, they
destroyed a rude Indian idol, and after entering Lake Huron arrived on
May 25th at Sault Ste. Marie Fort, where they were joyously received by
the Jesuits, Dablon and Marquette, with the little colony of twenty to
twenty-five Frenchmen.

Thence they started on May 28th, with a guide from the fort, and after
a strenuous journey of twenty-two days reached Montreal on June 18,
1670.

[Illustration: OLD MAP OF MONTREAL]

M. de Galinée on his return made a corrected copy of his map, which he
sent to M. Talon, with a copy of the "_prise de possession_," already
described, and these were of great use later, to the French government,
which sent them to London in 1687 as evidences of the pretensions which
the French claimed over Lakes Erie and Ontario, and the neighbouring
countries.

[Illustration: GALINEE'S MAP, 1669]

Dollier de Casson wrote a history of this voyage but no copy has been
found. Though the journey was unsuccessful in the conversion of the
Indians, yet it paved the way to succeeding explorations which were
quickly sent by Talon, and to the eventual evangelization of these
parts.

Of La Salle's experience, after leaving the Sulpicians, we have little
to record, as he was lost to civilization; but we see him coming
back at intervals to Montreal as his base to obtain supplies for his
explorations. On the 6th of August, 1671, he received on credit "in
his great need and necessity" from the hands of Migeon de Branssat,
procureur fiscal of Ville Marie, merchandise to the sum of 454 _livres_
_tournois_. Again on December 18, 1672, being in Montreal, there is
an "obligation" recorded at the city _greffe_ of a promise to pay, on
the August following, the same sum in peltry or money, either at the
house of Jacques Leber, where he lived, or at Rouen at the house of his
relative, M. Nicholas Crevêt, king's councillor and master of accounts.

Montreal, being at the head of navigation, became the starting point of
many subsequent expeditions. We may add here the expedition of Governor
General de Courcelles to Lake Ontario, which left Montreal on June 2,
1671. The object of the voyage was to conciliate the Indians who had
made peace but who were in danger of breaking it, irritated as they
had been by such breaches of faith as that related to have recently
occurred at Montreal, by the brutal assassinations, and to show them by
a dignified appearance among them not, in canoe, but "en bateau" that
their waters were not inaccessible, and that the French knew how to
punish and keep them in check. Another motive was to explore the lands
bordering on Lake Ontario with the view of establishing a fort and
colony and of diverting the peltry trade into French instead of English
hands, and of claiming those lands for the French.

Accordingly de Courcelles arrived at Montreal with a specially
constructed bateau of two or three tons under the management of
Sergeant Champagne and eight other soldiers. The governor's daring
expedition was joined at Montreal by M. Perrot, the local governor of
Montreal; M. de Varennes, that of Three Rivers; Charles Le Moyne, M. de
Laubia, M. de La Vallière, M. de Normanville and several others, as a
mark of esteem for the governor; finally the genial Dollier de Casson
as chaplain. It is from him that we have the history of the expedition.

The party of fifty-two went by road to La Chine and embarked above St.
Louis Rapids on the governor's barque and thirteen birch bark canoes.
On June 12th it reached the mouth of Lake Ontario. On the way a party
of Iroquois had been met and impressed with fear and respect. These
were now sent with letters to the missionaries to publish around news
of the mission of the governor general. The Iroquois were overwhelmed
by the dignity of the governor and his party, and for a time they kept
dumb with their hands and their mouths, in astonishment. Of the French
they said that they were demons and brought to a conclusion everything
they wanted. The governor, they thought an incomparable man. He made
capital of his success and menaced destruction to those who should
revolt, whose settlements he would take and destroy at will.

The party returned on June 14th and soon arrived in Montreal, the whole
expedition having taken only fifteen days. It was most successful with
the Indians and restrained their trade with the Dutch and English,
and even the latter, according to Marie l'Incarnation (letter No. 89)
feared lest they should be driven from their trading posts.


FOOTNOTES:

[104] La Salle wondered where the Ohio emptied itself. His mind wavered
between the Gulf of Mexico or the Vermillion River (the Gulf of
California). He seems to have favoured the latter hypothesis.

[105] The Abbé Véreault says La Salle hired a small house in Montreal
in November, 1668. At the southeast corner of St. Peter and St. Paul
Streets a tablet commemorates such a house. On January 9th he was again
in Montreal. Probably he found Lachine lonely and naturally sought the
town.

EDUCATION

     AT QUEBEC: JACQUES LEBER, JEANNE LEBER, CHARLES LE MOYNE (OF
     LONGUEUIL), LOUIS PRUDHOMME--MARGUERITE BOURGEOYS' SCHOOL AT
     MONTREAL--"GALLICIZING" INDIAN CHILDREN--GANNENSAGONAS--THE
     SULPICIANS AT GENTILLY--THE JESUITS AT MADELEINE LA PRAIRIE.


Another effort of Louis XIV, through his minister Colbert, was the
furtherance of education in the colony. It was naturally of a very
rudimentary character in these early days of scarce population. To
help, Colbert sent from the king, 6,000 _livres_ on April 5, 1667. The
work of education was in the hands of the clergy and religious with the
exception of that done at Montreal by Marguerite Bourgeoys, who had
not yet established her order. At Quebec, the Jesuits had since 1635
commenced a college for boys at which later young Joliet, who afterward
with Père Marquette, was the discoverer of Illinois, was taught to
defend philosophical theses. The Ursulines had a _pensionnat_ of thirty
girls, of whom Marie l'Incarnation, writing in 1668, says: "They gave
more trouble than sixty in France. The _externes_ give us some more
trouble." Still she says that there is a great desire to educate the
French girls and "they learn to read and write, to say their prayers,
learn Christian morals and all that a girl ought to know." Among the
_pensionnaires_ was Jeanne Leber, the daughter of Jacques Leber, the
Montreal merchant, and she was pious, and clever at elocution and lace
work.

At Montreal, as the population began to grow, Marguerite Bourgeoys
now handed over the boys, who were beginning to be educated with the
girls in the little primary school in the stable, to M. Souart, who,
since the return of M. de Queylus, had been supplanted as curate by
M. Gilles Pérot, and we find him styled in the documents of the time
"former curé--schoolmaster." In this occupation he was assisted by M.
Rémy, a deacon, who was afterwards entrusted for some time with the
primary education of the town. The education was given gratuitously,
but to maintain the schoolmaster, the syndic, accompanied by the clerk
of the court, canvassed subscriptions from private individuals. In
the fall, the Seminary made up the deficit. Marguerite Bourgeoys, and
her four companions, still taught during the day for nothing, without
any assistance as before, but during the night they worked at manual
labour for their support. "Thus," says Dollier de Casson writing of
1652, "what I admire most about these young women, is that being
without goods and willing to teach gratuitously, they have nevertheless
acquired by the grace of God and without being a charge to anyone,
houses and lands in the island of Montreal." In fact on August 29,
1668, Marguerite Bourgeoys bought a house thirty-six feet square
adjoining the "Congregation" from the widow of Claude Fézeret. On
September 21, 1668, she acquired from François Leber a grant of land,
with a house on it, at Pointe St. Charles. The site of this house, with
its buildings, can be seen to this day.

In 1669, she acquired, from Maturin Roulier, another piece of land with
a granary and a meadow, situated in the direction of Sault St. Louis.
All this, added to the original donation from M. de Maisonneuve, and
sixty arpents and more granted through the Seigneurs, out of which
she had put thirty-two under cultivation and on which she had placed
a granary, went in great part to support her community of pious lay
associates. In addition, on July 6, 1672, she bought an arpent of land
adjoining the "Congregation" and built on it a larger establishment,
as the number of her pupils surpassed the limited space of her stable
school.

On October 9, 1668, Laval at Quebec started his "petit séminaire," out
of the boys of which he hoped to draw the nucleus of a Canadian clergy.
He started with six Hurons, to whom were added eight French boys. In
1669 there were three Montrealers being educated there, probably on a
_bourse_ from the king's bounty, viz., Charles Le Moyne, de Longueuil;
Jacques Leber, brother of Jeanne, and Louis Prud'homme. The French
boys, supported by the king's bounty, boarded, however, at the Jesuit
College. Soon others joined, but as it was found that many of them
did not care for study, they were sent to Cap au Tourment, where they
learned mechanical trades and arts suitable to young colonists.

In 1670, there were only five teachers for the many calls on the
education of the girls, so Marguerite Bourgeoys went to France for
assistance, and after six months she saw Colbert, who promised to
assist her so that her congregation in May, 1671, received the approval
of the "Roi Soleil," Louis XIV, who was then with his brilliant court
at Dunkerque. She returned to Quebec in 1672, on August 14th, bringing
back a miraculous oaken statue of the Blessed Virgin, of some eight
inches in height for the church of Bonsecours, already projected in
1651 and to be built shortly. With her came several novices to join her
order, some of noble families, Elizabeth de la Bertache, Madeleine de
Constantin, Thérèse Soumillard, Pierrette Laurent, Geneviève Durosoy,
Marguerite Soumillard, and Marguerite Sénécal, who was the bursar of
the very slender funds of the party.

In addition to the _externes_ the congregation was beginning to have
boarders and was reaching such a point of utility, when she might
extend her work throughout the colony, that she had been persuaded to
ask for the above royal letters patent of incorporation. Her eventual
aim was to establish a regular congregation, with religious vows
of its own. For the present, Laval did not favour such a plan; he
rather wished to avoid a multiplicity of religious congregations in a
poor country, and he would have preferred her companions to join the
Ursulines at Quebec, becoming if necessary a branch establishment.

To this the independent Marguerite Bourgeoys was opposed. The Ursulines
was an enclosed order and the Montreal _congréganistes_ wished indeed
to live in community, but to circulate freely among the people--a new
idea then among religious congregations of women, very untried
and to which consequently the conservative bishop of Petrea was
not favourable. Yet, in 1689, on a visit of Laval to Montreal, the
foundress was authorized to spread her fellow workers over his diocese,
and it was about this time that they began to adopt a form of dress
based on an Acadian model.

The education of Indian children was greatly promoted under the new
policy of Louis XIV, and Laval, in the intention of "Gallicizing" the
natives in language, religion and customs, and eventually of allying
them in marriage with the colonists from France. This had been one
of Laval's objects in founding the "petit séminaire" of Quebec. He
persuaded the Jesuits and the Ursulines to start Indian schools for
Algonquin boys and Huron and Algonquin girls at Quebec. On September
27, 1670, Marie de l'Incarnation announced the marriage of some of her
girls to Frenchmen, with domestic success.

Laval also induced the Sulpicians at Montreal to undertake the work for
the children of those Algonquin and Huron parents who had been captured
by the Iroquois. The city archives contain the contracts of July 16,
1669, by which Jacques Akimega, thirteen years of age, and Louise
Resikouki, an Algonquin girl of twelve years, bind themselves to be
lodged and educated like French people till eighteen years of age, at
the seminary on a gift of 500 _livres_, provided by Dollier de Casson
on the stipulation that if the contract was broken the money shall go
for the education of other savage children.

Other Indian girls being forthcoming, Marguerite Bourgeoys undertook
their training at the congregation, and on November 14, 1672, we have
the contract of marriage between one of them, Marie Magdalene Catherine
Nachital, and Pierre Hogue, born at Belle-Fontaine, near Amiens.

One of the pupils of the congregation, called Gannensagouas and
baptized Marie Thérèse, after the queen of France, later in 1681 made
her religious profession as a nun in the congregation order, by that
time erected.

But the work of Gallicizing and civilizing these wayward,
liberty-loving, capricious children of the woods was an ungrateful
task. Most of those who entered the cloister of the Ursulines were like
birds of passage and they flew over the cloister walls to escape the
melancholy of their restrained lives, even when their parents did not
take them away. Nor did the Jesuits succeed any better. The Sulpicians
made a bold attempt by taking their Indian school into the country. M.
de Fénelon, one of their number, was charged to form an establishment
under the name of La Présentation at Gentilly, situated on the bank of
the St. Lawrence above Lachine, and in addition he secured a concession
on January 9, 1673, of the three islands opposite between Lachine and
Cap St. Gilles, which had been granted originally to Picoté de Bélestre
and were now exchanged for land on the island. These islands were then
named the Iles de Courcelles, after the governor general, and on one of
them at a place called the Baie d'Urfé, after the name of one of the
Sulpician missionaries, an Indian mission was established. We may here
mention the Jesuit missions, on the south shore facing Montreal of the
seigneuries of Madeleine la Prairie and St. Lambert, which commenced
with a few savages in 1669, the progenitor of the fifth site, the
Caughnawaga reservation, as known today.


NOTE

Caughnawaga, or Sault St. Louis, an Iroquois reservation, situated on
the south bank of the St. Lawrence, about ten miles above Montreal.
Area, 12,327 acres. Population in 1905, 2,100, all Catholics except
five or six families. The language is the Mohawk dialect. The sault (or
rapids) was an old seigniory, or concession, granted to the Jesuits
in 1680. To Père Ruffeix, S. J., is due the idea of thus grouping the
Iroquois neophytes on the banks of the St. Lawrence to guard them
from the persecution and temptation to which they were subject amid
the pagan influences of their own villages. In 1667 the missionary
prevailed upon seven communities to take up their residence at La
Prairie, opposite Montreal. Other Christian Iroquois from different
localities soon came to join the settlement, and in 1670 there were
twenty families. As the proximity of the whites was prejudicial to
the Indians, the mission was transferred, in 1676, several miles
higher up the river. This second site is memorable as the scene of the
saintly life and death of Catherine Tekakwitha (died 1680). In 1890
a granite monument was erected on the site, in memory of the humble
Iroquois virgin. In 1689, to escape the threatened attacks of their
pagan tribesmen, the Christian Iroquois sought refuge in Montreal,
where they remained eight or nine months. When the danger had passed
they founded another settlement a mile or two above the last. In 1696
another migration took place to a fourth site. Here it was that Père
Lafitau, S. J., discovered the famous "ginseng" plant, so valuable in
the eyes of the Chinese. The discovery created a great sensation, and
was for a time the source of lucrative commerce. The fourth site still
proving unsatisfactory, the settlement was moved to the present site
of Caughnawaga in 1716. From 1667 to 1783 the mission was conducted
by the Jesuits; from 1783 to 1903 by secular priests and oblates.
In 1903 it was again confided to the Jesuits. Among the more noted
missionaries were Fathers Bruyas, S. J.; Chauchetière, S. J.; Lafitau,
S. J.; Burtin, O. M. I.; Marcoux, who composed an Iroquois dictionary
and grammar; and Forbes, who drew up complete genealogical tables of
the settlement. The Indians are intelligent and industrious. Some are
engaged in farming, others take rafts down the Lachine rapids. The
industries are principally bead work and the making of lacrosse rackets
and snowshoes. Besides the presbytery, dating from 1716, and the church
built in 1719 and restored in 1845, there are in the village the ruins
of a French fort of 1754, two schools and a hospital. The government by
chiefs was, in 1889, replaced by that of a mayor and council. Note by

GARRISON LIFE--SLACKENING MORALS

     SIEUR DE LA FREDIERE--LIQUOR TRAFFIC WITH THE INDIANS--SOLDIERS
     MURDER INDIANS--THE CARION-DE LORMEAU DUEL--THE FIRST BALL IN

     DAY LABOURERS--THE TAVERNS--A POLICE RAID--"HOTEL" LIFE--BLASPHEMY
     PUNISHED--THE LORDS' VINEYARDS RUINED.


The history of garrison towns, sad to relate, seems always to be
besmirched with scandals having their origin among the soldiers. So it
was with Montreal after the settlement of the officers and men of the
Carignan and other regiments, in marked contrast with the times of de
Maisonneuve and his brave "milice," who had been especially trained
under religious influences and had not been reared in the atmosphere of
camp or barrack life.

Among the officers sent to Montreal, after the war of 1666, to command
the garrison, was the Sieur de la Fredière, a nephew of M. de Sallières
and a major in the Sallières-Carignan Regiment. This man, disfigured by
the loss of an eye, has left a name as one who was repulsive alike in
mind, in conscience, and in honour. He was banished to France after the
visit of Talon in 1667, who heard from the inhabitants such a catalogue
of acts of tyranny, injustice, and immorality against this officer of
the king that, having referred the charges to de Tracy, the latter
ordered the expulsion of the offender.

On de Sallières' remonstrance at the severity of the sentence, Talon
ordered on September 1, 1667, a judicial investigation into the charges
so that they might be presented in legal form.

Accordingly the copies of records of the judicial archives of Montreal
of September 17-19, preserved in the _greffe_ of the city, containing
these informations against la Fredière before M. d'Ailleboust, remain
as standing evidence produced by Jean Beaudoin, Mathurin Marsta, André
Demers, Claude Jaudoin, Anne Thomasse, his wife, and Marie Anne Hardye,
wife of Pierre Malet, of the justice of the above charges. Those who
wish to read the scandalous details can do so at will.

One of the charges against la Fredière had been that of selling liquor
to the savages, and of fraudulently diluting it, at that. He was not
without imitators among the officers who, not content with selling them
liquor in their settlements, followed them to their hunting fields,
so that through their continual drunken orgies, the savages brought
back but few skins, and thus the habitants of Montreal, who had gone to
great expense in advancing them on credit, arms, powder and provisions,
were reduced to great want. Dollier de Casson, contrasting the
singlemindedness of M. de Maisonneuve with the new régime of avaricious
officers, says that if things went on so, the country would be ruined.

"It is impossible that it can hold together," he says in his account of
the year 1667, "if individuals have not the wherewith to buy utensils,
linen, clothes, in a country where wheat has no value. Owing to the
cupidity of the officers, the inhabitants, not having any peltry for
exchange, are forced to sell their arms to provide the wherewith
to cover themselves, and having only their feet and arms to defend
themselves, they will become the prey of the Iroquois, should they wish
to begin to war again."

Speaking of this period Marie l'Incarnation (letter of October, 1669)
says "that it would have been better to have less inhabitants and
better Christians," and Dollier de Casson in his history of the year
1664, bewailing the departure of M. de Maisonneuve, says that "since
Montreal had fallen into other hands, vices unknown before had crept
in."

The common soldiers followed the licenses of their betters and were
within an ace of endangering the safety of the colony by rekindling
the smouldering embers of Iroquois hatred. In their greed the soldiers
of the Montreal garrison had killed a Seneca chief for his peltry,
having plied him with brandy and killed him. His body they loaded with
weights to sink it, but it was found floating by some Iroquois who
brought it to Montreal, and thus the murder was out. As we have related
they were put to death, on the day of the departure of La Salle for
the West. About the same time, in the winter of 1668-69, three other
scamps who had left the Carignan Regiment and settled at Montreal
cruelly massacred six Oneidas (Onneiouts) on the banks of the River
Mascouche, first intoxicating them in their cabin, and then during
the night falling on them, not even sparing the woman and her young
children. And this for a load of fifty elk and beaver skins! One of
the assassins confessed the brutal deed to La Salle, as we have said,
before departing.

The first armed attack on life at Montreal among Frenchmen was also
committed by a soldier, viz., by Carion, a lieutenant of La Motte's
regiment, on the person of M. de Lormeau, an ensign of M. de Gué's
company, in payment of a grudge. The case was brought up before M.
d'Ailleboust in May, 1671, and the records of the _greffe_ giving
the depositions of the witnesses, tell an exciting story, of how, on
Pentecost evening, after vespers and just before the first sound of
the "salut" pealed, the Sieur de Lormeau was walking with his wife
towards the common and had passed the seminary enclosure, apparently
on the way to his dwelling, when nearing the house of Charles Le
Moyne, of Longueuil, who was at table entertaining Picoté de Bélestre
and a merchant of Rochelle named Baston, they saw M. de Carion coming
to meet them. They advanced towards him and they were near Migeon de
Branssat's house when Carion, seeking a pretext for provocation, called
out, "Coward! Why have you struck this child? Why don't you attack me?"
"Coward yourself!" was the reply. "Go away!" On the instant Carignan's
sword is out and de Lormeau follows suit. Three or four blows are
struck and they clinch one another. In the struggle Carion, taking
his sword by the blade, tries to plunge its point into de Lormeau's
stomach. De Lormeau's péruque now falling to the ground, Carion takes
the opportunity of seizing his sword by the hilt and deals blows with
its pommel on de Lormeau's unprotected head till the blood began to
flow. Whereupon de Lormeau's lady, Marie Roger Lepage, terror-stricken
and beside herself, runs back to Charles Le Moyne's house and disturbs
the supper party by crying, "Murder! Murder! M. de Bélestre, come
out!" The three, leaving the table, rushed to separate the struggling
officers but in vain. Picoté de Bélestre then exclaimed in indignation:
"Since you won't separate, then kill yourselves if you want to." And
now, one called Gilles, a former servant of M. Carion, comes on the
scene with drawn sword, brandishing it in defence of his master, but
doing no damage. M. Morel, an ensign in the same company as Carion
and a partner in the same quarrel against de Lormeau, also comes on
with naked sword and makes a thrust at de Lormeau, much to Charles Le
Moyne's disgust strongly expressed, at seeing an unarmed man so struck.

By this time de Lormeau had received three wounds, when two priests
from the seminary ran out to separate them, M. de Frémont and M.
Dollier de Casson, the strapping soldier priest, whose presence soon
acted as a peacemaker. But de Lormeau took the affair to the court, as
we have seen.

The military introduced a love of gayety, good cheer and dissipation
into the colony. In Quebec in 1667, on February 4th, the first ball was
held and the Jesuit journal of the period adds this reflection: "May
God grant that there are no sad consequences."

At Montreal, larcenies, breaches of respect for authority, blasphemies
and Sabbath breaking are now recorded.

In 1670 an attempt was made for the first time, in Montreal to make a
corner in wheat to the detriment of the poor. By an act of January 26,
1671, Talon fixed the price at three _livres_ and two sous the bushel,
and punished a refractory miller, de la Touche-Champlain who, profiting
by the dearth of wheat, sold it at twenty sous, and even then it was
mixed with Indian corn.

The "_volontaires_," or day labourers, began to be a trouble, as they
were more numerous at Montreal than elsewhere. Many of these were lazy
and wanderers, and would not hire themselves out or take up land, and
doubtless many of the petty larcenies now commencing, were due to these
gentlemen living on their wits. The woods appealed to them and the
"_coureurs de bois_" would soon be recruited from them. The simplicity
of primitive manners was going. An ordinance of the "_procureur fiscal_"
in the records of the city for March 9, 1670, shows that precautions
had to be now taken to prevent sacks of wheat and flour from being
willfully changed at the mill, and their amounts from being falsified.

Theft was severely punished, according to the "_greffe_" of April 15,
1667. A man who had stolen thirteen bushels of wheat was condemned
to be marked with the royal "_fleur de lys_" and to be sent to the
Canadian galleys for three years. On December 20, 1668, another was
sentenced to stand outside the parish church for a quarter of an hour,
as the people were leaving after mass on Sunday. The town clerk read
his sentence out to the people and an officer of justice affixed to the
culprit's breast a notice in large characters so that all might read
the legend, "_voleur de blé_" (wheat thief).

Again, on March 8, 1670, a man convicted of stealing from a store by
night was condemned by M. d'Ailleboust, under the good pleasure of the
sovereign council, to be hanged on a market day, so that by "this dire
example, the evil disposed might be intimidated and prevented from
committing greater larcenies and other crimes." The condemned man,
however, appealed to the sovereign council, and the execution does not
appear to have taken place.

Tavern frequentation was also a source of dissipation and trouble. The
cabarets became the rendezvous of Montrealers, although they were only
licensed for strangers and marketers. In 1669, the intendant came to
town and on this occasion at the request of the Seigneurs brought about
a special ordinance dated April 2, 1669, which ran as follows:

"Desirous of doing all in our power to stop these dissipations and
debaucheries, which serve only for the corruption of morals and the
destruction of families and of the colony, we, in execution of this
ordinance of the king, very expressly forbid all those who shall keep
cabarets or taverns, in the town as well as in the bourgs, villages
or other places, to open them to receive any person on Sundays and
holy days and during divine service, under a penalty of a fine for the
first offence, and of prison for the second. We forbid, under the same
penalties, all those domiciled in towns, bourgs and villages where
there are cabarets or taverns, even those who are married and have
families or households, to go to eat or to drink in these places, and
those who keep these cabarets or taverns to give them food or drink, or
gaming, under any pretext whatever. They can only sell them wine by the
pot, which they shall take home to drink.

"We forbid them also, under the same penalties, to receive in these
places any dissolute or lewd men or women, or to give them food or
'aliment' of any kind, or likewise to give to any _engagé_ (hired man)
or 'volontaire' food or drink.

"They shall, however, be allowed to give drink in moderation to
travelers and to give board and lodging to those who shall be obliged
to reside in this town to manage their affairs. Finally we forbid
all innkeepers to give credit for their dues or to exact any promise
or obligation of payment under the penalty of loss of their stock,
for which they shall not take any action of recovery, conformably to
Article 128 of the 'Custom of Paris.'"

This ordinance appears to have been strictly enforced for some time,
for we find the syndic himself on August 19, 1670, appearing before
M. d'Ailleboust to answer a charge of eating and drinking at an inn
on a Sunday or a feast day during divine service. The syndic owned up
to having contravened the law on a week day, but brought witnesses to
prove that he had not broken the ordinance of the Sunday and feast day
observance. The innkeeper was condemned to pay the law expenses of the
case and to pay a fine to the church.

Even those who broke the ecclesiastical abstinence in these cabarets
seem to have been in danger of the secular arm.

A watch was kept by the Seigneurs on the weights and measures and they
had them stamped with their seal. In order to see that innkeepers did
not substitute others, the _procureur fiscal_, or his substitute,
accompanied by the clerk of the justices and two sergeants, went on a
tour of inspection from time to time. (Greffe de Ville Marie, June 11,
1673.)

In 1676, on a surprise visit after vespers one Sunday,--"on information
received" doubtless,--these officers found four men being entertained
at one of the cabarets, now beginning to open up without authorization
and apparently contravening all the above-quoted ordinance. One June
11th the four men and the innkeeper were fined. On September 27th the
judge of the seigneurs, forced to cut down the growing abuses, ordered
all inns to be closed under penalty of a 100 _livres_, provided that
the autumn then ending and the forthcoming winter did not bring any
strangers to Montreal. He declared at the same time that in the spring
there would be established one or two "cabaretiers hôteliers," which we
may translate as "hostelry innkeepers," to board and lodge traveling
merchants coming to Montreal. Shall we consider this the first
indication of the hotel life of Montreal, the commercial metropolis of
Canada?

The crime of blasphemy was severely punished. On Ascension Day, 1668,
the new royal edict, supplementing a former one of 1651, was placarded
at the door of the parish church at Montreal.[106] Various fines and
imprisonments are meted out to those who shall sin. At the sixth
offence it is ordered that the blasphemer's upper lip shall be cut with
a hot iron, the lower lip on the seventh, and if after this he still
continues his blasphemy, his tongue is to be cut out.

A man near Lachine, having attempted outrage on two young girls of
eleven and seven years, was fined and banished, on June 2, 1672, from
the Isle of Montreal, for seven years.

Evil livers were punished even after death. A former corporal, who had
been killed by accident by an Ottawan at the "Little" River, was, in
July, 1674, refused burial in holy ground but was allowed to be buried
on the commons by one who offered to do that service on the condition
that the clothing covering the deceased man should be left him.[107]

We may sum up the history of the transition of morals from the pristine
fervour of the early days of Maisonneuve to the early years of royal
colonization, in the words of Sister Morin in her annals: "But this
happy time is past. The war with the Iroquois having obliged our good
king to send us troops at several times, the officers and soldiers have
ruined the Lord's vineyards, and vice and sin are almost as common in
Canada as in Old France. This it is that makes good people grieve,
especially the missioners who wear themselves out in preaching and
exhortation almost without fruit, regretting with tears and sobs those
happy bygone years, when virtue flourished, as it were, without any
labour on their part."

NOTABLE LOSSES

     DE QUEYLUS FINALLY LEAVES VILLE MARIE--DE COURCELLES AND TALON
     RECALLED--TRIBUTE TO THEIR ADMINISTRATION--MGR. DE LAVAL
     ABSENT FOR THREE YEARS--THREE DEATHS--MADAME DE PELTRIE--MARIE
     L'INCARNATION--JEANNE MANCE--HER LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT.


In the autumn of 1671 the Abbé Queylus left Montreal with M. d'Allet
and M. de Galinée, the cartographer. It was his hope to further the
interests of his beloved Ville Marie, but his failing health kept him
in France, where he died on March 20, 1677.

Towards the end of 1671 de Courcelles was recalled, to be followed
by Talon in the following year. This was the result of the growing
estrangement between the governor and the intendant. Both had wisely
written asking for their recalls and each had urged the plea of ill
health. Both received characteristic letters from the king accepting
their resignations, and Colbert wrote to Talon: "As you are both
returning to France, the little difficulties that have arisen between
M. de Courcelles and yourself will have no consequences."

All's well that ends well! The administration of both had been
excellent and their influence on Montreal was productive of great
good. On April 6, 1672, Louis Buade, Comte de Frontenac, was appointed
governor general.

On his arrival Talon and de Courcelles left together, towards the end
of 1672. We cannot do better than repeat the skillful appreciation
of the "Relation" for that year which gracefully ignored in silence
the blamable acts of their administrations and remembered the good,
so that, commenting on the chagrin felt at the sight of the vessels
in the harbour bearing M. de Courcelles and Talon away, it said:
"'Eternellement,' we shall remember the first, who has so well reduced
the Iroquois to their duty, and 'éternellement' we shall desire the
return of the latter to put the finishing touches to the projects he
has begun so profitably for the good of the country."

This same year Mgr. de Laval went to France to settle the long deferred
question of the establishment of a bishopric of Quebec and was absent
for three years, as we shall relate.

But although the king created Talon Comte d'Orsainville in 1675, having
already made him Baron des Islets in 1671, he never returned, and
Canada was without an intendant for three consecutive years, when on
June 5, 1675, M. Duchesneau was appointed to succeed him.

Various griefs fell upon the colony at this time. On November 18, 1671,
Madame de la Peltrie, one of the earliest pioneers of Montreal, died at
the Ursuline Convent at Quebec, where she had dwelt in humble seclusion
for eighteen years, in charge of the linen of the community.

Six months later another, Marie de l'Incarnation, whose valuable
letters of this early period, from 1639-72, we have frequently quoted,
also went to her reward.

But a greater grief fell upon Montreal on June 18, 1673, when the
beloved and venerable Jeanne Mance, now aged sixty-six to sixty-seven
years[108] passed away at 6 o'clock in the evening in the quiet of
the Hôtel-Dieu which she had so lovingly founded and administered.
According to her wish, made verbally to M. Souart, the executor of
her last will and testament, her body was buried in the church of the
Hôtel-Dieu and her heart was encased in a double vase of metal and
placed "en dépôt" under the lamp of the tabernacle of the Blessed
Sacrament until the new parochial church, then being built, should be
ready to receive it. Unfortunately it never reached its destination,
for during the delay of the church erection a fire, breaking out in the
Hôtel-Dieu, consumed the venerable relic.

TOWN-PLANNING AND ARCHITECTURE

THE FOUNDATION OF THE PARISH CHURCH AND BON SECOURS CHAPEL

     OF THE NAMES OF THE STREETS--COMPLAINTS AGAINST CITIZENS STILL
     CULTIVATING THE STREETS--ORDERS TO BEGIN BUILDING--THE NEW PARISH
     CHURCH--THE FOUNDATION STONES AND PLAQUES--THE DEMOLITION OF THE
     FORT FORBIDDEN--THE CHURCH OF BON SECOURS--THE POWDER MAGAZINE IN
     ITS GARRET--A PICTURE OF MONTREAL.


In 1672, peace prospects being bright, town planning received its
first conscious impetus. Hitherto "Low Town," the neighbourhood of the
fort and principally the portion near the Hôtel-Dieu and Maisonneuve's
house, now the manor of the Seigneurs of the Seminary, with the small
collection of houses around the fortified redoubts at Ste. Marie and
St. Gabriel, had housed the slender population, fearful of attack. The
advent of the troops enabled them to think of opening up higher land,
and of forming a future "Upper Town," on which some had already taken
concessions. There it was intended to build a parish church; for at
present the chapel of the Hôtel-Dieu served the purpose.

Accordingly, following the _procès verbal_, of March 12, 1672, we find
Dollier de Casson, representing the Seigneurs, accompanied among others
by Bénigne Basset, at once town clerk and town surveyor, tracing the
first streets,[109] starting from the site of the land reserved for the
projected parish church of Notre-Dame, and making out the limits of the
concessions granted. Notre-Dame Street was first marked out, starting
from a well opened by a former syndic, Gabriel le Sel _dit_ Duclos,
and extending eastward to the mill redoubt on the elevated portion of
ground called afterwards "Citadel hill."[110] Notre-Dame Street, then
the greatest street of the city, was thirty feet broad. Bénigne Basset
placed a post at intervals on either side of this road, affixing the
leaden stamp of the seminary to each. St. Joseph Street, now known
as St. Sulpice, having been already named and used as a trail and in
some sort a street, had a breadth of eighteen feet assigned it, and
the property lines marked out. A similar breadth was given to St.
Peter Street, in honour of St. Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, the
patron saint of M. Pierre Chevrier, Baron de Fanchamp, one of the first
founders of the Company of Montreal.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FIRST STREETS LAID OUT IN VILLE MARIE]

St. Peter Street ran down to the common and the street skirting this
common was named St. Paul Street, after the patron saint of Paul de
Chomedey de Maisonneuve. This was now formally traced, because the
line of houses already built on the north side of this common had been
constructed along it.

A fourth street was named St. James, the patron saint of M. Jacques
Olier. This was north beyond Notre-Dame, beginning with Calvary Street
and terminating with St. Charles Street, of which we shall speak later.
A fifth street, eighteen feet broad, was that of St. Francis Xavier,
parallel to St. Peter. It was called by Dollier de Casson St. Francis,
after his own name, Francis, in honour of St. Francis d'Assissi.
Later on, Xavier was added in deference to St. Francis Xavier, the
apostle of the Indies. Calvary Street, at the extremity of St. James
Street, was given a breadth of twenty-four feet; it went north towards
the mountain. Another street of twenty-four feet, going in the same
direction from Notre-Dame Street, was called St. Lambert, in honour of
the brave Lambert Closse. These streets were broader than the rest, for
they were meant for carriage service.[111]

A ninth street, eighteen feet broad, parallel to that of St. Joseph,
and abutting on St. James Street, de Casson called St. Gabriel, after
the patron saint of Gabriel de Queylus and Gabriel Souart.

Finally the tenth street, parallel to the latter and also abutting St.
James Street, was named St. Charles, after Charles Le Moyne, Sieur
de Longueuil. The city plan being made, it was necessary to carry it
out. Some of the streets afterwards formally laid out, had already
been marked out by pathways that had grown up. Thus, that running
from the fort to the Hôtel-Dieu, became St. Paul Street; that to St.
Jean-Baptiste Street, opened in 1684, was started as early as 1655. St.
Dizier Street, opened in 1691, was traced as a path in 1664. Another
pathway was traced from the fort to Bon Secours Chapel in 1657. The
original Place d'Armes, opposite the fort, was opened in 1650.[112]

Those who had taken land adjoining these streets were, by their
contract, obliged to build houses, this same year. But some of the
proprietors of lands crossed by these traced roads seemed to have
neglected the landmarks placed by Dollier de Casson and went on
cultivating and sowing as before. This was resented by those anxious
to build, as it blocked the way to the hauling of their building
materials. Accordingly in March and June of 1673 there are records of
an assembly of inhabitants, including Mademoiselle Jeanne Mance and M.
d'Ailleboust, addressing a request to M. Dollier de Casson that as he
had himself mapped out the boundaries of the streets, apportioning to
each its line, length, breadth, angles, and its name for the building
and decoration of the town, he should take means to prevent individuals
tilling and sowing any of these streets. To this just demand, Dollier
acceded, and he forbade any further cultivation of the roadways,
leaving each one free to enclose his lot with stakes or quick-thorn
hedges. The offending parties submitted, especially so as they saw
that the roads crossing their properties increased their value--an
elementary principle of city planning.[113]

By 1675, some had neglected to enclose their ground, and in consequence
of the complaint of those that had done so, the seigneurs put up a
notice, dated January 12, 1675, warning the tardy ones that if they
did not bring the necessary building materials immediately after the
following spring seeding, "to rear their buildings, destined for the
ornamentation and decoration of their town and to facilitate trade both
with the inhabitants and the strangers, the seigneurs would reclaim
these concessions, redistribute them, on demand, to others presenting
themselves."

One of the delays leading to the erection of houses on the streets,
of the upper town section, traced in 1671 was the interruption of the
building of the new parish church determined on, on the occasion of a
pastoral visit of Mgr. Laval, when at an assembly of the inhabitants,
held on May 12, 1669, it was settled that operations should begin on
June 8th under the direction of Bénigne Basset at a monthly honorarium
of thirty _livres_. But though stones were brought to commence the
work at once, two years elapsed before the site could be agreed upon.
That which had been chosen, once the property of Jean Saint-Père,
was considered as being too low down. Two years later, the naming of
Notre-Dame Street indicated the resolution arrived at by the seminary
to build the church of Notre-Dame higher up, at the head of St. Joseph
Street and facing Notre-Dame Street. At a meeting held on June 6, 1672,
the proposition to build on such land bought by the seminary from
Nicholas Godé and the wife of Jacques Le Moyne, was accepted.

Besides, a promise of the grant of the land, the sum of a 1,000
_livres_ _tournois_ for three years was offered in the name of M. de
Bretonvilliers, the superior of the Sulpicians in Paris. On June 19th,
at a new assembly, it was agreed upon to engage François Bailli, a
master mason, to take charge of the construction and to receive one écu
for every day's work and thirty _livres_ a month while the operations
lasted. If there had hitherto been delay, the next steps were very
swift.

Next day, on June 20th, the land transfer was made, the contour of the
new church traced, and on June 21st the foundations were laid. On June
29th, the feast of SS. Peter and Paul, after vespers, a procession
formed from the Hôtel-Dieu Chapel at the foot of St. Joseph Street,
to the head of the street, and Dollier de Casson, as superior of
the seminary, planted the cross, with a great gathering of people
witnessing the ceremony.

Next day, June 30th, after high mass the same gathering repaired
thither again in procession. The first five stones were placed, each
bearing the following inscription on a leaden plate:

                            "D. O. M.
                                et
          Beatae Mariae Virginis sub titulo Purificationis."[114]

These five stones were each accompanied by the arms of the persons
placing them. The first was placed in the middle of the _rondpoint_ by
the governor general of Canada, Daniel Rémy, Seigneur de Courcelles,
being one of his last public acts before being succeeded by Comte
Frontenac in the September following. The second bore the arms of Jean
Talon, intendant, inscribed in advance, for being unable to be present
he was represented in the ceremony by Phillipe de Carion, lieutenant
of M. de La Motte--Saint Paul's regiment. The third was placed by the
governor of Montreal, Chevalier François Marie Perrot, Seigneur of St.
Geneviève.[115]

The fourth was placed by Dollier de Casson in the name of M.
Bretonvilliers, superior general of the congregation of St. Sulpice
in Paris. The last was fittingly placed by Jeanne Mance, the
administratrix of the Hôtel-Dieu, who had seen Montreal grow from its
earliest infancy and had been so long the mother of the colony.[116]

[Illustration: FOUNDATION STONE PLACQUES]

There was great desire to have the church soon completed. Divers
persons imposed voluntary assessments on themselves, some in money,
others in materials and labour.

The priests of the seminary resolved to demolish the ancient fort,
now being allowed to fall into ruins, so as to employ the wood of
the buildings and the stone bastions of the enclosure, in the church
construction. Indeed in their eagerness they started the demolition
before waiting to receive M. de Bretonvilliers' consent from France.
Eventually he disapproved, fearing that it was premature, for if the
Iroquois renewed their attacks they would repent their action. The
officers of the king also forbade them to proceed further, and thus the
final demolition of the battered old fort of de Maisonneuve and his
harassed and beleaguered veterans, did not take place till ten years
later, in 1682 or 1683.

In 1676 a meeting was held, on January 26th, to raise funds for the
completion of the church, and it was determined to hold a canvass
in the island, which resulted in a collection of 2,070 _livres_;
and finally, although M. Souart had engaged himself to furnish the
necessary wood, all this assistance was insufficient, and the church
building, dragging on for two years, was not finished till 1678. The
church was in the form of a Latin cross, with "bas côtés," terminated
by a circular apse; its front entrance at the south end, built of cut
stone, was composed of two orders, Indian and Doric, the last being
surmounted by a triangular pediment. The beautiful entrance, erected
after the plans of the king's engineer, Chaussegros de Léry, in 1722,
was flanked on the right by a square tower with a square belfry tower,
surmounted by a fleur-de-lys cross twenty-four feet high. The church
was built directly in the middle of Notre-Dame Street and projected
into Place d'Armes Square, measuring 140 feet long, 96 broad, while the
tower was 144 feet high. This first church of Notre-Dame was of rough
stone pointed with mortar.[117]

The erection of the parish church now being on its way permitted funds
for the long deferred church of Bon Secours, also to be gathered. The
miraculous statute brought from France was meanwhile housed in the
little wooden chapel raised in 1657 by Marguerite Bourgeoys before
leaving for France and there it remained till the new stone building
was commenced. It was not, however, till June 29th, the feast of SS.
Peter and Paul, in the year 1675, that M. Souart placed the first stone
in the name of M. de Fanchamp, bearing a medal of the Blessed Virgin
and a leaden tablet bearing the inscription:

                            D. O. M.
                    Beatae Mariae Virginis
                et sub titulo Assumptionis[118]

The bell was cast from the metal of a broken cannon used against the
Iroquois and given some time previously by M. de Maisonneuve. It
weighed a little less than 100 _livres_ and the casting was paid for by
M. Souart.[119]

The site chosen was still thought to be far from the town, but near
enough for easy pilgrimages. In order to secure its perpetuity the
sisters requested the bishop to make it an inseparable annex to the
parish church, to be served by the parish clergy. To this the bishop of
Quebec[120] acceded in the _mandement_ of November 6, 1678. In addition
he imposed upon the _curé_ the duty of having mass celebrated there
each Feast of the Visitation, the principal feast of the new order, and
of going thither in procession every Assumption Day. These conditions
still obtain. A Sulpician of Notre Dame Church today is known as the
Chaplain of Notre Dame de Bon Secours, the first being M. Frémont.

[Illustration: The Church of Notre Dame de Bonsecours dates from three
different periods. The first chapel was erected in 1657. It was built
of oak and the foundations were in stone and it measured only forty
feet in length by thirty feet in width. In the basement of this chapel
a school was kept (the first in Montreal, in 1659) for the education
of little children. This small chapel was replaced in 1676 by a stone
building which measured seventy-five feet in length by forty feet in
width. The latter was destroyed by fire with a part of the town in
1754. The present Church of Notre Dame de Bonsecours dates from 1772.
It measures one hundred and twenty feet in length by forty-six feet in
width. It was reconstructed in 1888.]

As the chapel was at some distance from the chief buildings, its garret
was used for the storage of powder for the safety of Ville Marie, there
being no other magazine. M. de Denonville, governor general, writing
on November 13, 1685, to the minister said: "At Montreal I have found
the powder in the top of a chapel towards which the people have great
devotion. The bishop has strongly urged me to take it away, but this I
have not been able to do since I have found no other place where to put
it without danger of fire." The church was burned down in 1754.[121]

To give the reader a comprehensive view of the outlook for Montreal
at this period (1674-76) we may quote from Parkman's "Old Régime,"
where he imagines a journey up the river to inspect the lines of
communication by the formation of settlements and villages resting
under the newly established feudal system:

"As you approached Montreal, the fortified mill built by the Sulpicians
at Pointe aux Trembles towered above the woods; and soon after the
newly built chapel of the Infant Jesus more settlements followed, till
at length the great fortified mill of Montreal rose in sight, then the
long row of compact wooden houses, the Hôtel-Dieu and the rough masonry
of the Seminary of St. Sulpice. Beyond the town the clearings continued
at intervals till you reached Lake St. Louis, where young Cavelier
de La Salle had laid out his seigniory of Lachine and abandoned it
to begin his hard career of western exploration. Above the Island of
Montreal the wilderness was broken only by a solitary trading station
on the neighbouring Ile Pérot."--Parkman, "Old Régime," p. 241.

We have now to consider the fortunes of Montreal under the reign of
Frontenac, as governor general, and M. Perrot, as local governor.
Louis de Buade, Count de Pallua et de Frontenac, arrived in Canada in
September of 1672, whereas M. Perrot had been in Montreal since 1670
as governor, by the goodwill of the seigneurs, and by the letters
patent of March 14, 1671, he held the rank also by royal commission.
He considered himself in a strong position, but Frontenac was also a
strong man, and when the clash came in the autumn of next year, the
old opposition of Quebec and Montreal was renewed. Both antagonists
had powerful protectors at court. Unfortunately Perrot's character was
haughty and violent, and his unworthy attempts to enrich himself by
engaging in the nefarious liquor trade, leaves us unable to sympathize
with his case, as we did with that of the gentle and single-minded
de Maisonneuve. To illustrate this, Perrot, as governor of Montreal,
could not openly engage in the trade, yet he chose a situation on an
island given to him by Talon as his seigneury and named after him,
"Ile Perrot," lying at the toe of Montreal, between the seigneuries of
Bellevue and Vaudreuil and at the western end of Lake St. Louis, an
excellent spot for a receiving station for peltry from the Indians,
descending from above. There, he placed a former lieutenant of his
company, Antoine de Fresnay, Sieur de Brucy, who acted as his agent and
gave protection to the deserting _volontaires_ now illegally becoming
_coureurs de bois_, who were growing numerous around Montreal and were
being more or less openly encouraged by the local government. These
were given liquor and merchandise in exchange for the products of
their hunting expeditions. The consequence was that frequent disorders
occurred through their irregularities.

A delegation consisting of the foremost citizens called on M. Perrot,
respectfully remonstrating on this situation. Among them were Migeon
de Branssat, Charles Le Moyne, Picoté de Bélestre, Jacques Leber,
and Vincent de Hautmesnil. The haughty governor received them with
insult and he imprisoned their spokesman, Migeon de Branssat, who as
_procureur fiscal_ was acting as judge in place of M. d'Ailleboust,
then absent. "I am not like M. de Maisonneuve," said he, "I know how
to keep you in your proper places." Next day, Dollier de Casson as a
representative of the seigneurs expostulated at such imprisonment,
especially as the course of justice was being held up; but to no avail
at the moment. Perrot was governor by royal commission, and he meant to
show it. Eventually, however, the _procureur fiscal_ was freed and the
court sittings continued.

It will be remembered that Marie François Perrot had espoused Madeleine
de La Guide, niece of Talon, and under the régimes of Courcelles and
his uncle, Talon, the illicit commerce had either passed unperceived or
authority had closed its eyes. But he was to meet his match under the
new government.

Let us now turn to Frontenac, who was soon to cross swords with Perrot
of Montreal. The new governor general, now a man of fifty, having
been born in 1622, was a very complex character with high qualities
and serious defects. He was every inch a Gascon, a boastful talker,
an exaggerator, fond of posing and a little of a bully. Yet he could
be gay, was a lover of a good table, a man of the world, brilliant,
communicative, and generous with his friends, as he was haughty and
distant with those he disliked.

[Illustration: STATUE OF FRONTENAC

(By Philippe Hébert)]

From the age of fifteen he followed camp life, serving at first under
Maurice, Prince of Orange, and his reputation for bravery was sound. He
was placed at the head of a Norman regiment and distinguished himself
in Flanders, Germany and Italy; at the battle of Orvietto he broke
his arm. In 1664, while at St. Gothard, Turenne sent him to fight
against the Turks, to the Island of Candia, whence he returned to
Paris, covered with glory. He rose to the rank of a _maréchal de camp_
or brigadier general. His married life was not too domestic. Himself,
the godchild of Louis XIII, his father being the chief majordomo
and captain of the Château de St. Germain-en-Laye, he married the
daughter of one of his neighbours in Paris, Lagrange Trianon, a master
of accounts. Madame de Frontenac was handsome, gallant, witty, fond
of high society, imperious, and very independent. In these qualities,
she resembled monsieur and after a time Frontenac found warring more
to his taste than the fireside, and madame lived with Mademoiselle
Montpensier, and together these two "divines" held a kind of court of
their own in their "apartment," in which they set the tone for the best
society of Paris. It was, therefore, no doubt through her influence,
combined with his services as a distinguished soldier to the king, that
the office of governor general of Canada was secured for him, to help
him in his poverty.

As a governor he had high gifts of administration; according to
Charlevoix, "his work and his capacity were equal; ... his views for
the development of the country were great and just." He knew how
to maintain his position, and even to gain the affection of those
he ruled, especially the Indians. But he was absolute, dominating,
despotic, violent, headstrong, ambitious, jealous, choleric and
impatient of opposition. He also came full of prejudice against the
clergy and especially the Jesuits.

On arriving at Quebec, this "High and Puissant Seigneur," as he
prefixed to his title of "Governor, Lieutenant-General for the King
in France," introduced a gayety and high style of living, somewhat
surprising and unaccustomed to the Canadian _bourgeoisie_. In official,
governmental life he assumed the reins with a high hand. He was, as
he thought himself, a "vice-roi" and he would model the colony on the
lines of France. Thus his preliminary act was to call a representative
convocation of the people in three several orders or estates, the
clergy, the noblesse, and the third estate, to receive the oath of
fealty from them, a proceeding which Colbert evidently disapproved of
as too democratic, and opposed to the centralizing policy, then in
favour in France, a policy which eventually ruined the initiative and
delayed the progress of the colony. The minister wrote on June 13,
1673: "It is good for you to know that in the government of Canada you
always ought to follow the forms practiced in France, where the kings
have for some time considered it better for their service, not to
assemble the 'Etats Généraux.' Also, you ought but rarely, or better
say, never, give this form to the body of habitants of your country;
it will even be necessary, in a little time, and when the colony is
stronger than it is now, gradually to suppress the office of the
syndic, who presents the requests in the name of all the inhabitants;
it being good that each speaks for himself and not one for all." What
is everybody's business is no one's, was evidently Colbert's view. Thus
the people never learned the art of self-government.

The new governor very soon showed his desire to be sole master of
the situation. Of his own responsibility he had made several police
regulations and had established aldermen at Quebec and, contrary to
the rights of the Company of the West Indies, then still existing, he
had attributed to them the power of administering police regulations.
This brought a letter from Colbert, dated May 17, 1674: "His Majesty
orders me to tell you, that you have therein passed the limits of the
power given by him. Besides, the police regulations ought to be made by
the Sovereign Council, and not by you alone. The power which you have
been given by the king gives you entire authority in the command of the
army, but with regard to what concerns the administration of justice,
your authority consists in presiding at the Sovereign Council. The
intention of His Majesty is that you take the advice of the councillors
and that it is for the council, to pronounce on all matters which
belong to its jurisdiction."

On his arrival he quickly turned his gaze on Lake Ontario, lately
visited by M. de Courcelles, and already the construction of a fort was
in his mind, to divert the fur trade towards Montreal, and on to Quebec
in place of it descending to Albany. Writing to Colbert, on November 2,
1672, two months after his arrival, he says: "You will have heard from
M. de Courcelles of a post which he has projected on Lake Ontario and
which he believes to be of the utmost necessity, in order to prevent
the Iroquois taking peltry to the Dutch and to force them to trade with
us, as it is but just, seeing that they hunt on our lands.

"The establishment of such a post will strengthen the mission at
Kenté, already settled there by the _Messieurs de Montréal_. I beg you
to believe that I will spare no trouble or pains or even my life to
attempt to do something to please you."

It is alleged by the Duke de St. Simon in his mémoires (Paris 1829,
Vol. II), that Frontenac came to France a "ruined man," that he was
given the governorship for his means of living, and that he would
sooner go to Quebec than die of hunger in Paris. His disinterestedness
in setting up a trading post for the good of the colony is therefore
somewhat discounted.

Frontenac determined to construct this fort before the return of the
vessels from France. In order to obtain the necessary men, boats and
canoes, he relied on the precedent of M. de Courcelles' official visit
as governor general to Lake Ontario. To impress the Indians with the
dignity of the French conquerors, he called a _corvée_ from Quebec,
Montreal, Three Rivers and other places to supply the above at their
own expense. In the meantime he had built two bateaux to face the
rapids and currents and mounted on them two pieces of cannon. These he
had painted, which was considered a novelty.

At Montreal there was no little murmuring at his novel and burdensome
_corvées_, for to avoid the Rapids of St. Louis, he made the
inhabitants repair the road leading to Lachine. He requisitioned about
200 canoes and 400 men and kept them at work until he finished his fort
there.

La Salle was then in Montreal, and Frontenac, seeing an ally in this
already experienced traveler, wrote to him to proceed to Onondaga, the
ordinary rendezvous of the Iroquois nation, and there to explain, that
the projected expedition was a visit of courtesy to the Mission of
Kenté and to the neighbouring tribes. La Salle, nothing loath, set out
ahead, leaving Montreal in the beginning of May, 1673. Frontenac left
Quebec on June 3d and arrived at Montreal on June 15th, having delayed
his journey, being received in the other towns on his way. Arriving at
5 o'clock that evening, the governor general was met at the wharf by
Perrot, the governor of Montreal--no doubt with some jealousy and some
resentment at the _corvées_ demanded by his superior--and the principal
citizens, with their military companies. After the volleys of musketry
and cannon, there came the addresses of the officers of justice and
that by Sieur Chevalier, the syndic of the people. Then they made their
way to the temporary parish church attached to the Hôtel-Dieu and there
the clergy held their reception and also harangued him. After which the
Te Deum was sung in thanksgiving for his happy voyage and the governor
retired to the hospitality of Fort Maisonneuve, not as yet demolished
as we know.

For thirteen days, there was a great bustle at Montreal, fixing up
canoes and loading them, and arranging the men in companies,--all
requisitioned in the name of the king. The last preparations for the
important journey were broken, however, by the celebration of feast
of St. Jean Baptiste; on this occasion M. de Salignac Fénelon, the
brother of the famous archbishop of Cambrai, returned from Kenté with
M. Durfé, and about to return together, with the expedition, pronounced
an elegant eulogium on the governor-general. At last all to join the
vice-regal party had left the town and gone by road to Lachine, whence
on June 28th, all being reunited, the expedition started--two flat
bateaux, nearly one hundred and twenty canoes and about four hundred
men, among them being Charles Le Moyne, who was a skilled interpreter.

We cannot follow its progress. For us, it is interesting to record it
in connection with Montreal as resulting in the establishment of Fort
Frontenac, or Cataracqui, the modern Kingston, the construction and
management of which was now entrusted to a Montrealer, Sieur de la
Salle to whom, on May 13, 1675, on the occasion of his visit to France,
letters of nobility were given with the property and government of the
new fort and some adjacent leagues of land. La Salle had gone to France
in 1674, well recommended by Frontenac. His family, seeing a fortune in
the new trading station, procured the necessary funds for him to pursue
his career, and presented a memorial of La Salle's discoveries and his
good actions, which secured the above privilege. La Salle named his
seigneury Fort Frontenac in honour of his patron. His enemies say that
he became Frontenac's agent, as de Brucy was that of Perrot.

On returning from Lake Ontario, Frontenac and Perrot soon began their
duel. Towards the end of autumn, 1673, Frontenac, receiving Perrot at
Quebec, reprimanded him severely for the continued disturbances already
mentioned at Montreal. Perrot respectfully promised better care, in
regard to the observances of the king, for the future, and returned to
Montreal. But hardly had he been back eight days, when trouble began.
Two _coureurs de bois_ had returned and gone to lodge with M. Carion,
the officer of whom we have spoken. Charles D'Ailleboust, the judge,
sent Sergeant Bailly to arrest him, whereupon Carion obstructed and
ill treated the sergeant. Instead of punishing Carion, Perrot sent
for D'Ailleboust and reprimanded him for having sent the sergeant to
the house of an officer, without warning him, and threatened him with
prison himself, if he repeated his conduct, notwithstanding any orders
from the governor-general.

The astonished D'Ailleboust acquainted Frontenac with this incident,
and he, scenting rebellion, immediately dispatched three of his guards
with their lieutenant, Sieur Bizard, to arrest Carion. Bizard did this
faithfully, leaving a guard over him. But he had made a grave error
in etiquette in so doing. Before leaving Quebec he had received from
Frontenac a letter for Perrot, acquainting him of the intended arrest
in his jurisdiction, but fearful of the wrath of the local governor,
Bizard sought the house of Jacques LeBer, to leave the letter there, so
that it might be delivered to Perrot after the departure of the guard
from the town. Meanwhile Madame Carion had quickly acquainted Perrot
of her husband's arrest and immediately the indignant governor, with
a sergeant and a guard from the garrison, angrily confronted Bizard
at LeBer's house and threw Frontenac's letter, presented him, back in
Bizard's face.

"Take it back," he said, "to your master and warn him to teach you
your official duties, better, a second time." He then put him into
prison but released him the next day with a letter to M. Frontenac.
Bizard, however, had a statement of his arrest made out which was
signed by Jacques LeBer, La Salle and a domestic, the witnesses of
it. Four or five days later, Perrot, coming to hear of this, sent
LeBer to prison without any form of justice; but La Salle he left
alone, keeping him under watch during the day. But by night the nimble
explorer, with Norman adroitness, leaped the enclosure of the house and
hurried secretly to Quebec to tell his patron Frontenac of his flouted
authority. Thither also journeyed later the friends of M. LeBer to make
their protestation.

If Frontenac's officer had erred in trespassing on the prerogatives
of the governor of Montreal, the latter, by imprisoning Bizard, had
similarly encroached on those of the governor-general. They could have
cried quits, but it is alleged that Frontenac was eager to deprive
Montreal of its autonomy, and herein was his excuse. It was Frontenac's
policy to appear to smoothen out the situation. He wrote to Perrot
inviting him to set LeBer at liberty and to come himself to Quebec
to render an account of his conduct, and to M. de Salignac Fénelon,
the Sulpician, who had eulogized him in the parish church of Montreal
before departing to Fort Frontenac, he wrote another, saying that he
wished to terminate amicably the differences between himself and M.
Perrot. Both fell into the trap. M. Fénelon, determined to accompany
M. Perrot, started with him on the ice of the river in the heart of
winter, and they arrived at nightfall in Quebec on the 28th of January,
1674.

The next morning M. Perrot made his call on the governor and hardly
had he set his foot across his threshold than he was arrested by
Lieutenant Bizard, his sword being taken from him and then led to
prison in solitary confinement in the Château St. Louis without any
formal process, and there he remained till the following November. The
simplicity of M. Fénelon was rudely shocked by this "_volte face_."
He sought the governor to intercede for his friend and when he strove
to obtain a pass to see the prisoner he only angered Frontenac, who
accused him of wishing to corrupt his guards.

Back went Fénelon on the St. Lawrence on his snowshoes. Hardly had
he reached Montreal when Dollier de Casson received several letters
from the governor-general, complaining of the conduct of M. Fénelon
"as unworthy of a man of his character and birth." There is reason
from after-events to believe that Fénelon's zeal was not sufficiently
tempered with discretion. Montreal having now need of a governor,
Frontenac speedily appointed on the 4th of February, as commandant
in his absence, one of his devoted friends, M. de la Nouguère,[122] an
ensign in a cavalry regiment. In the act, making this appointment, he
explains his superseding of the town major, Sieur Dupuis, as due to
the advanced stage of his age, but he bids him to have de la Nouguère
recognized by the officers of the garrison. (Vide this document in the
City Hall Archives, dated February 10, 1674.) He then ordered the new
commandant to arrest Sieur de Brucy and two of his servants, and to
send M. Gilles de Boisvinet, the judge of Three Rivers, to conduct the
trial and to inform against all _coureurs de bois_ in Montreal--an
insult to M. Charles D'Ailleboust, whose faith and sympathy he
distrusted. Certainly Frontenac had made himself master of Montreal.

These actions, derogatory to the privileges of the Seigneurs granted
in 1644, were borne with wise moderation, though under protest, to
avoid undue friction in a difficult position. A document of Dollier
de Casson, dated March 22, 1674, on the occasion of a protest against
Boisvinet, who had gone beyond the limits of his commission, following
a former juridical protestation against the infringement of their right
to appointment of a governor, dated March 10, 1674, shows this clearly
and explains the neutral policy now adopted.

Meanwhile in his prison at Quebec, the deposed governor of Montreal
refused to be judged by Frontenac and the Sovereign Council, and asked
to have his case tried by the king. In justification of his firm action
at Montreal, Frontenac wrote to Colbert some months later, that he
had hanged one of the _coureurs de bois_, the same that had lodged
with Carion, and that the others, to the number of thirty, had been
thus intimidated and had submitted to fines and had taken up lands as
habitants. "I can assure you," he says, "with certainty, that there
are now not more than five _coureurs de bois_ in Canada, of whom three
belong to M. Perrot's garrison, whom he allowed to desert; the fourth
is a farmer on the island bearing his name. You will gather from this
whether I have reason or not, in retaining him as a prisoner."

That there were only five _coureurs de bois_ in Canada seems an
exaggeration unless we take it that they were dispersed over the North
American continent. For from Montreal there wandered many an expedition
which left its mark there. Accompanying these were the "voyageurs,"
"coureurs de bois" and "_bois brulés_," as they were variously named.
These often allied themselves with women of the Indian tribes and
united the vices of both races. Restlessly they pursued their vagabond
life, and it would be impossible to find a northern Indian tribe
unaffected by these wanderers. In 1678 David Greysolon Duluth or the
Sieur Du Luth built the first trading post at the western end of Lake
Superior. The only post of Minnesota bears his name. He was by no means
a saint--he was a worthy gentleman of the wild woods--a knight of the
fur trade--a great leader of the coureurs de bois, and he enhanced his
fortunes with illicit trading in spirits. But he was a power among the
Indians in the land of the Dakotas (Minnesota), which was the name
of one of the principal tribes formed into a league, or Dakota, and
given to the general body. They were called the Ojibways north of Lake
Superior and Nadowaysioux, the last syllable of which, "Sioux," being
used as a nickname for them by the French. Other historical sites as
that of Chicago were first visited by those who started from Montreal,
such as Marquette, the Jesuit, and Joliet, who arrived at the site of
modern Chicago in August, 1673.

Meanwhile Frontenac was exercising a control and overlordship over
Montreal as the following document will indicate:

"Count Frontenac, king's councillor, governor and lieutenant general
for His Majesty in Canada, Acadia, Newfoundland and other countries in
Western France.

"Being necessary to create and establish a captain of militia in the
Town and Island of Montreal, under the authority of its local governor,
to exercise and manoeuvre with army, and to put it in a better state
of defence, in the event of an attack from enemies. We have appointed
and do establish, the Sieur Le Moyne in the said position of captain,
under the authority of its local governor, commandant of the militia of
the said town and island. To whom we ordain, that he must be careful
that he drills the said inhabitants of the said place as often as he
can, and at least once or twice a month; to take care that they keep
their arms in good condition; to prevent as much as in his power, that
they trade or do away with their arms, and to execute all orders that
we may give to him, being assured of his fidelity to the service of the
king, of which he has given many proofs in numerous engagements, as
well as of his bravery and experience in drill. This warrant is given
to Sieur de la Nougère, present commandant in the said Town and Island
of Montreal, that he may make the appointment known to the inhabitants
of the said island, to whom we commend that they must obey in all
duties appertaining to his functions, on penalty of disobedience, and
we give him full power and authority to command the same, in virtue of
powers confided to us by His Majesty. On proof of which we have signed
these presents and have appended the seal of our arms and have further
signed by one of our secretaries.

"Given at Quebec, the 24th day of April, 1674.

                    "Frontenac.

                "By His Lordship's orders,

                    "B. Chasseur."

The Sieur de la Nougère, above mentioned, is M. Th. X. Tarieu de
Lanaudière. The spelling of the period was not as hidebound as today.
Frontenac's secretary spelled phonetically like so many of his
contemporaries--a source of embarrassment to historians.

CHURCH AND STATE

The difficult equipoise of neutrality, aimed at by the Seigneurs in
the Frontenac-Perrot dispute, was rudely jolted on Easter Day, little
more than a month later, in a most dramatic manner. The scene was
the crowded Hôtel-Dieu chapel, then being used as a parish church,
while the new parish church higher up the street was being slowly
raised, and all the notables of Montreal were present at the High
Mass. The celebrant was M. Perrot, the curé, in the absence of the
superior of the seminary, Dollier de Casson, who was confined to his
bed in the hospital from the effects of fever, after an accident
on the St. Lawrence, when the ice having broken he had almost lost
his life through cold from the long immersion in the water, before
rescue came. The deacon was M. de Cavelier, La Salle's brother, and
the subdeacon M. Rémy, the lawyer Sulpician. After the gospel, M. de
Fénelon, the same who had preached the eulogium of Frontenac the year
previously, mounted the pulpit. The preacher announced that he would
speak on the Christian's double necessity, of dying with Christ, and
of rising with him. Following the scholastic divisions of St. Thomas
Acquinas he divided the life of man into the vegetative, sensitive and
rational states. The sinful vices, destroying the vitality of this
threefold life, must die in Christ and the new man must arise with
Christ, purified and reestablished in his threefold life. In pursuing
this second point the preacher entered into the details of the various
dispositions that risen Christians of different conditions should
manifest as a sign of the new Easter life in them. Turning to those
vested with temporal authority, he said, "that the magistrate,
animated with the spirit of the risen Christ, should have as much
diligence in punishing those faults committed against the person of
the prince, as he had of readiness in pardoning those against his own
person...."

La Salle, who had been sitting towards the back of the chapel, near the
door, and had listened with approbation to the familiar doctrine of St.
Thomas, which as a Jesuit he had studied in his philosophical course,
began now to show unusual interest in the preacher's application. In
order to get a better view of the speaker, he rose from his seat. He
saw that M. de Fénelon, a man who was known to have been in sympathy
with Perrot and to have had trouble with his own patron, Frontenac, was
treading on delicate ground and might commit himself. La Salle had,
what journalists call, the reportorial instinct for "news." Besides,
since the famous expedition of 1669, his relations with the Sulpicians
were cold. As the preacher proceeded, La Salle's face flushed with
anger, and casting his eyes around, he drew the special attention of
several to what the preacher was saying. Among these was Jean Baptiste
Montgaudon de Bellefontaine, the brigadier of de Frontenac's guard.
Soon La Salle's gestures attracted the attention of the celebrant,
seated in the sanctuary, to what was being said; but he shrugged his
shoulders in return, as though to convey that no personal allusions
were being made. The preacher had also noticed La Salle, "and changed
colour," said Bellefontaine later in giving his _procès verbal_. The
preacher went on: "The Christian magistrate should be full of respect
for the ministers of the altar, and should not maltreat them, when
in the exercise of their duty, they strove to reconcile enemies and
to establish peace everywhere; that he should not make creatures to
praise him, nor oppress under specious pretexts persons also vested
with authority and who, serving the same prince, were opposed to his
enterprises; that he should make use of his power to maintain the
authority of the monarch and not to further his own interests; that
looking upon his subjects as his own children and treating them as a
father, he should be content with the rewards which he received from
the prince, without troubling the commerce of the country and without
ill using those who did not share their profits with him; and, that in
fine, he should not harass the people with extraordinary and unjust
_corvées_ for his own interests, under cover of the king's name, who
was unaware of their extent and that they bore so heavily on them."

These phrases were shortly afterwards attested to, in the official
declarations of MM. de la Salle, Jean Baptiste Montgaudon de
Bellefontaine, Jacques LeBer, de la Nouguère, commandant of Montreal,
Rémy, and Jean Baptiste Migeon de Branssat, procurator fiscal of the
seigneury of Montreal and others, before Commissioners Legardeur de
Tilly and Dupont, sent from Quebec as the court of investigation which
opened on May 2d and lasted for a fortnight.

To La Salle, every phrase appeared leveled at the conduct of the
governor general, especially as the preacher was M. de Fénelon. Jacques
LeBer testified that the curé, who came to visit him the same day,
declared that the words of the preacher appeared to him so imprudent
and out of place that he was very near intoning the Credo to cut
the sermon short. Others saw in them only generalities within the
legitimate sphere of a preacher. The Sulpicians took immediate steps
to disclaim to M. de la Nouguère all responsibility for the utterance
of one of its members. It was in no way authorized or foreseen, and
Dollier de Casson left his sick bed to confirm this and to assure the
commandant that M. de Fénelon should never preach again. They also
wrote immediately to Frontenac a similar disclaimer. That afternoon
M. de Fénelon, before his fellow clergy, gave his word of honour as a
man and a priest, that he had meant no conscious personal allusion,
but had spoken in general terms of all bearing authority. There is
no doubt, however, that M. de Fénelon, though a virtuous and zealous
missionary, had been "blazingly indiscreet." In his want of prudence,
he had also but recently personally canvassed the householders of the
Island of Montreal for signatures to a petition to be sent to court,
on behalf of Madame Perrot, in which the subscribers stated that they
had no complaint to make against her husband. The memorial was signed
by many prominent men, such as Louis Chevalier, the syndic, Zacharie
Dupuis, Sieur de Verdun and Mayor of the Isle of Montreal, Philippe de
Hautmesnil, Picoté de Bélestre and others. Madame Perrot had previously
approached d'Ailleboust to make the canvass, but the judge, already in
hot water, was too wary. M. de Fénelon fell an easier victim, and his
action was not calculated to prejudice M. de Frontenac in favour of
his pretentious of absence of _malice prepense_, in his Easter sermon.
La Salle communicated the details of the latter to Frontenac. On April
23d, in his anger, the governor wrote, ordering the Sulpicians to expel
the offending preacher from their community. This they could not do,
without a formal conviction of rebellion, as required by canon and
civil law. M. de Fénelon, however, resigned from the "congregation,"
using his right to do so, as the Sulpicians was not a "religious
order," and thus saved the situation. In this way, there was no
acquiescence to any claim of jurisdiction of the governor general over
ecclesiastics. M. de Fénelon retired to Lachine as a secular priest,
and is reckoned one of the first _curés_ of this place.

With the above letter M. de Frontenac sent out a set of questions to
be answered by each of the Sulpicians. This was equivalent to giving
evidence against M. de Fénelon in a civil court, whereas they claimed
the right of trying such a case in a prior ecclesiastical court,
according to precedent. They, therefore, refused, but later consented
when assured that their information would not be used juridically.
Commissioners Legardeur de Tilly and Dupont accordingly arrived at
Montreal, and opened a court of investigation, beginning on May 2d.

On August 21st M. de Fénelon appeared by command before the Sovereign
Council at Quebec. He came determined to protest against the competency
of the civil court to try him, relying on the privileges granted by
the kings of France. "Clericus, si cogatur ad forum laici, debet
protestari," was an axiom of many jurisconsults of the period, such as
Aufrerius, president of the parliament of Rouen.[123]

Among other privileges, a cleric summoned before the lay court, unless
sent there for misdemeanour by his bishop, could reply seated and
uncovered. On entering the hall of justice, M. de Fénelon, uncovered,
made for a seat. The governor reproved him, and Fénelon quoted his
canonical privilege. The heated head of the council then told him,
he might walk out if he would not take the attitude ordered. M. de
Fénelon demanded rather that M. de Frontenac should leave the council,
as he was acting not as his judge and the head of the council, but as
his opponent. The council, however, sustained the governor and M. de
Fénelon was taken as prisoner to the brewery under the conduct of an
usher.

On August 23d M. de Fénelon again appeared, presenting his protest in
writing, and refusing to be tried till sent by his bishop, when he
would give his reasons for alleging that the governor was his opposing
party and was not acting as the president of the council. Again the
recalcitrant de Fénelon went back to his prison. The council, however,
began to doubt their power to try the case, and it sent to the king
the judgment on M. de Fénelon, with the statement that there remained
only three judges whom he did not refuse. Similar action was taken in
M. Perrot's case. The unfortunate governor of Montreal had been kept
a close prisoner since January 26th and had not ceased sending to the
council protest upon protest,[124] refusing to accept his judges, and
demanding, without avail, to have his case concluded and sent to be
tried before the king in France.

In the month of September some of the council wavered and M. de
Villeray refused to act against either, alleging that there was such
a natural connection between the affairs of M. de Fénelon and M.
Perrot that having refused to act in the case of M. Perrot, fearing
to displease the late Intendant Talon, the uncle of Madame Perrot,
who had given him his own nomination to the council, he could do not
less for M. de Fénelon, and his reasons were accepted by the council.
(Archives de la Marine, October 22, 1674.) Thus it was that Frontenac
had to allow M. Perrot and M. de Fénelon to go for a time to France by
the last vessels sailing in November. With them went Dollier de Casson,
now broken in health and suffering from the loss of sight in one of
his eyes since his fall on the ice, and M. l'Abbé d'Urfé, on important
business to the country. The latter intended to complain at court of
the vexatious conduct of M. de Frontenac in regard to the missionaries,
whose letters to France he opened and to whom he handed, among those
arriving for them, only such as he pleased. Perhaps it was knowledge of
his intention, added to his displeasure at M. d'Urfé's friendship for
Fénelon, that made the governor refuse to allow M. d'Urfé's servant to
accompany him on the voyage. Thus the Montreal party sailed, hoping for
redress in France.

At the same time M. de Frontenac, scenting recrimination, wrote, on
November 14, 1674, to Colbert: "I am sending M. Perrot to France and
with him M. l'Abbé Fénelon, so that you may judge of their conduct. On
my part, I submit mine to everything that it shall please His Majesty
to impose on me; if I have been found wanting, I am ready to accept
the correction pleasing to him. A governor would be very much to be
pitied, if he was not sustained, having no one in whom he can trust,
and being ever obliged to distrust everybody; and when he should commit
any fault, it should assuredly be very pardonable, since there are not
wanting snares stretched for him, so that having to avoid a hundred of
them, it would be difficult not to fall into one. The distance, too,
from the court and the impossibility of receiving new orders, except
after a long interval, make his faults necessarily no short ones. Thus,
Monseigneur, if it shall have happened that I have made any false step,
which may displease His Majesty, he will have the goodness to pass it
over and to believe that it has occurred rather by an excess of zeal to
do my duty and to carry out His intentions, than from any other motive."

But Colbert was likely to be sympathetic to the Montrealers. When M.
d'Urfé arrived he was warmly welcomed by the minister, for on the 8th
of February following, his son, the Marquis de Seignelay contracted
a marriage with M. d'Urfé's cousin-germain, the rich and youthful
heiress, the Marquise Marie-Marguerite d'Allègre, only daughter of
Claude-Ives d'Allègre. The chosen intermediary in the marriage was also
M. de Bretonvilliers, the superior general of the Sulpicians at Paris.
Hence M. d'Urfé's mémoire on the conduct of M. de Frontenac, received
by Colbert and communicated to the king, on April 22, 1675, brought
from the latter the following series of counsels to guide the governor
in his future conduct: "I have noted with attention," wrote the king,
"all that is contained in your dispatches of February 16th and November
14th last, and to explain to you my designs and all they contain, I
will tell you that in a feeble colony, such as yours, your principal
and almost sole employment ought to be, to maintain and conserve all
the inhabitants there and to induce others to come thither. You ought
then to use the power I give you, only with the greatest moderation and
gentleness, more particularly with regard to the ecclesiastics whom
it is your duty to uphold in their functions, in peace and concord,
without giving them any trouble: being assured, as I am, that they will
never be wanting in the obedience due me, nor in their readiness to
inspire my people with the same sentiments.[125] Although I do not attach
importance to all that has been told me of many petty annoyances, given
by you to the ecclesiastics, I deem it necessary all the same for
the good of my government, to warn you of them, so that you correct
what is amiss, if they are true. But my present order is, that you
make known to no one, that I have written to you about them; and that
even when the bishop or the ecclesiastics speak of them, you will not
cherish any resentment against them.... They say, then here, that you
are not willing to allow the ecclesiastics power to attend to their
missions and their other functions, or to leave their stations without
passports, even to go from Montreal to Quebec; that you cause them to
journey to you often for very slight reasons; that you intercept their
letters and do not allow the liberty of writing; that you have not been
willing to allow M. d'Urfé's valet to cross over to France with his
master; nor permitted the grand vicar of the bishop of Petrea to take
his place at the Sovereign Council, in accordance with the regulation
of the month of April, 1673. If any part of the things is true, or even
the whole, you must make amends."

In a similar delicate strain Colbert wrote on May 13, 1675, adding that
he wished Frontenac to pay some mark of consideration to M. d'Urfé, now
that he had become allied to him as his daughter-in-law's first cousin.

The conduct of M. de Fénelon at Montreal, both for his sermon and
his support of M. Perrot, was blamed, and caused a letter dated May
7, 1675, to be written by M. de Bretonvilliers to the Sulpicians at
Montreal: "I exhort you all to profit by the example of M. de Fénelon.
For being too much mixed up with the world, and with affairs which did
not concern him, he has mismanaged his own affairs, and has done wrong
to those of his friends, while wishing to serve them. In these kinds of
affairs, which have regard only to personal quarrels, neutrality is to
always be approved...."

The upshot was that M. de Fénelon was not allowed to return to Canada
by the king, on recommendation of M. de Bretonvilliers. The criminal
procedure instituted by de Frontenac was not allowed to proceed. A
letter from the king to Frontenac, dated April 22, 1675, explains
this: "I have blamed the action of M. de Fénelon and I have ordered
him not to return to Canada. But I must tell you that it was difficult
to institute criminal procedure against this cleric and also to oblige
the priests of the Seminary of Montreal to testify against him; at
least, he should have been left in the hands of the bishop or the grand
vicar. Besides, the differences between you and the priests of the
Seminary of Montreal are entirely settled and can have no consequences.
As, moreover, the superior of the Seminary of St. Sulpice (M. de
Bretonvilliers) has assured me that all the priests of his community,
who are at Montreal, live in the respect and obedience due to me,
and to your dignity, I desire that you forget all that has passed.
Strive then, assiduously to reunite to yourself all minds, that these
differences may have divided."

On the 14th of May a characteristic letter of Colbert followed this
up: "It is to the good estate and good government of the king and the
colony, that you show particular consideration for the community of the
Seminary of St. Sulpice at Montreal, of which M. de Bretonvilliers, the
superior, is one of my best friends."

M. Perrot did not escape as easily as did M. de Fénelon, at the hands
of the king, being sent to the Bastille Prison for three weeks. On the
same April 22d as above, the king writing to Frontenac said: "I have
seen, and examined with care, all that you have sent me concerning the
Sieur Perrot; and after having also seen the memoirs, which he has put
in for his defense, I have condemned his action in having imprisoned
the officer of the guards sent to Montreal. To punish him, I have put
him for some time in the bastille, in order that this punishment may
not only render him more circumspect in the future regarding his duty
but will serve moreover as an example to restrain others. But having
given this satisfaction to my authority, which has been violated in
your person, I must tell you, to direct you in my views, that you ought
not, without absolute necessity, carry out an order in the territory of
a local governor, without having apprised him of it, and also that the
punishment of ten months, accorded him, has appeared to me too great in
proportion to the fault committed. This is why I have made him undergo
the punishment in the bastille only long enough to repair publicly the
violation of my authority. Another time, I direct that in a like fault,
you must be content with the satisfaction offered you, or with some
months in prison, or to transfer the case for decision to me, sending
over to France the defaulting officer; imprisonment for ten months
being a little too rigorous."

But thanks doubtlessly to M. Talon's interest in his relative, M.
Perrot was confirmed by the king in the government of Montreal, as the
above letter continues: "After having left M. Perrot some days in the
bastille I will send him back to his government and I will order him
to call on you and to offer you his apologies for all that has passed.
After which I desire that you will not retain any resentment against
him, but that you will treat him in accordance with the power I have
given him. Finally you ought to punish the _habitants_ only for capital
faults, avoiding lengthy punishments, because minds are thus divided,
and embittered and are diverted from their principal work, which is to
provide for the surety and subsistence of the family."

Colbert's letter of May 13th begged Frontenac to live in good harmony
with M. Perrot, urging his family alliance "with persons for whom I
have great consideration," of whom, no doubt, Talon was one.


THE GOVERNOR, THE INTENDANT AND THE SOVEREIGN COUNCIL

One of the gravest charges alleged against Frontenac, by the
Montrealers now in France, was that he had usurped the powers of the
council and that he had rendered himself absolute and all powerful.
This brought about that, at Colbert's instigation, the king himself
named the councillors and fixed the rank they should hold in the
Sovereign Council. In consequence, on April 25th of this year, Louis
XIV named M. Denis-Joseph Ruette d'Auteuil as his _procureur général_;
on May 10th following, the seven councillors in order of rank: Louis
Rouer de Villeray, first councillor, Charles Legardeur de Tilly,
Mathieu d'Amours, Nicholas Dupont, René-Louis Chartier de Lothbinière,
Jean Baptiste de Peyras and Charles Denys. To render them the more
independent of the governor, the king named on June 5th M. Jacques
Duchesneau, then treasurer of France at Tours, as the intendant, making
him the real president of the council and reserving for the governor
general only a simple presidency of honour. He arrived on September
25th. He further endowed the new intendant[126] with full powers
concerning the administration of justice, police and finance, with the
order, to see to it that all the inferior judges and other officers of
justice should be upheld in the exercise of their functions without
any interference--a privilege often demanded by the Montrealers. He
arranged that the intendant should judge conjointly with the Sovereign
Council all civic and criminal cases, in conformity with the _coutume
de Paris_ and that the council should make all police regulations;
with this clause, however, that the intendant could, if he deemed it
opportune, act alone as supreme judge in civil matters, and could make
all police regulations and ordinances.[127]

At this time the remuneration of the governor general was 3,000
_livres_, of the local governors of Montreal and Three Rivers 1,200,
and the members of the Sovereign Council 300 each. This was small, but
there were not many inhabitants as yet. A letter of the minister to
Duchesneau, dated April 15, 1675, showing surprise that there are only
7,832 persons in Canada, 1,120 guns and 5,117 horned cattle helps us
to understand the situation. The smallness of salaries would certainly
tempt the governors to engage in commerce.

Finally the king, on June 5th, by a new declaration confirmed the
establishment of the Sovereign Council, reserving the right to name the
councillors after a place fell vacant. The council was to be composed
as before, of the governor general, the bishop of Quebec or in case
of his absence in France, of his representative, the grand vicar, the
intendant and seven councillors. To take away from the governor general
every pretext of mixing himself in the transactions of the council, the
king ordered that in conformity with the custom of the sovereign or
supreme courts of the kingdom of France, the intendant, although only
holding the third place of honour, should, however, as president of the
council, consult the opinions of the councillors, count their votes,
pronounce their resolutions and enjoy the same advantages as the first
presidents of the courts of the kingdom. (Edits et Ordonnances, Quebec,
1854, pp. 83, 84.)

Still, four years later, bitter animosities continued in the council
for some months to the exclusion of all other business, as to the
exact position of the governor and the intendant. In spite of the
ordinance of 1675, Frontenac claimed to be entered in the minutes as
the chief and president of the council, in that the intendant was only
the acting president. Thus was the governor general "cribbed, cabined
and confined." His wings were cut and his powers more closely defined
and limited than ever. Moreover, a rival was placed by his side,
to be a thorn in it for many a long day. He was no longer absolute
in the council chamber. Thence began the long series of vexatious
complaints of Frontenac and Duchesneau of encroachment on one another's
authority,--this intolerable bickering eventually ending in the recall
of both, by the instructions of the king on May 10, 1682. The new form
of legislation, however, was a marked improvement, and since it was
the outcome of Montreal agitation for clearly defined and responsible
government, hence, the length of treatment that has been accorded to
its constitutional history of this picturesque period may be not out of
place.

Letters went to and fro; one from the minister to Duchesneau on April
25th severely blames him, that in relying on the great power given
him and by his title of president, he was wrong in thinking himself
nearly equal to the governor, and that the latter can do nothing
without consulting him. The reverse should be the position. When the
governor interdicts any affair at the council, he had only to submit.
The council can only make representations and if the governor does not
listen to them, let the matter be submitted to the king. Even then
the governor should be shown the complaints, so that he may be in a
position to make his reply. This would seem to show that Frontenac's
position was upheld. Still the trouble went on and finally produced on
May 20, 1679, a decision of the Council of State, that in the minutes
of the Sovereign Council M. de Frontenac shall be solely intitled, the
governor and lieutenant general of His Majesty in New France and M.
Duchesneau as the intendant of justice, police and finance, but that
he should also exercise the functions of the first president of the
council--a re-affirmation of the declaration of His Majesty of June 5,
1675,--a victory for the Intendant Duchesneau.

In a letter from the king to Frontenac this latter had been styled,
"Chief and President of the Council," and relying on this, Frontenac
wished to force the recording clerk to inscribe this intitulation. On
the other side it was argued, that a private letter giving incidentally
this title to the governor, could not prevail against the formal
ordinance of June 5, 1675, not revoked. The quarrel became so envenomed
that all the business of the council was paralyzed during many months.
For as surely as the time came for the minutes to be read and the
titles of those present to be enumerated, the pother began anew. The
clerk received contrary orders, and nothing was done. Finally he was
sent to prison by M. de Frontenac. Some of the councillors, opposing
this, came also under his condemnation, and M. de Villeray, M. de Tilly
and M. d'Auteuil were sent to "rusticate" with their friends while
awaiting the order to go to France to answer for their conduct. Rival
factions were also created in the colony, and Montreal was divided.

Even with this new restatement of the position, the spheres of
authority of the governor and of the intendant were still ill-defined.
There were apparently two independent heads, yet overlapping; still
one was supposedly subordinate to the other. Consequently harmony was
impossible and the history of the French régime up to the final fall
is one continual attempt to harmonize contradictions. Had the French
government been less paternal, less desirous of centralization and less
jealous of delegating its powers; had it given a measure of home rule
or representative government, the rulers in Canada would have found
a way to solve their difficulties, even those of church and state,
without having to recur, like children in every trivial dispute, to
the jealously guarded center of authority at headquarters, thousands
of miles away. "_L'état c'est moi_," said Louis XIV, Le Soleil, in
his brilliant court at Versailles, while Canada was a big growing boy
confined to petticoats. If the French Government had even given the
governor and intendant some real initiative power, instead of expecting
them to be the mere executive arm of a not too well informed directing
mind, far away, the sense of responsibility would have kept things
in order, with less friction and with more progress. If only it had
trusted its own appointed official advisers, instead of encouraging
every subordinate Jack-in-office to write to His Majesty criticizing,
misrepresenting, and offering suggestions on the administration of
colonial affairs, there might have been some unity. The policy of
_espionage_ of the departments, on one another, encouraged by the
mother country, only provoked tale bearing, tittle-tattle, suspicion,
jealousy, cabals, intrigues, discord and infringement on one another's
privileges, and was one of the chief causes leading to the slow
development of colonization, the paralyzation of the trade and the
delay of the progress of New France.

It must not be imagined that M. Perrot was entirely free from further
trade arrangements and scandals at Montreal. A document, believed to
have been written by Duchesneau in 1681 to the king, speaks of the
ill-treatment meted out by him or his employés to many persons. He is
accused of ruining the country, of trading publicly, of having a store
on the "Common" and holding open market there, of trading himself and
through his representatives and soldiers, in the camp of the Indians,
and of monopolizing the market by having a guard at the end of the
bridge leading to it which allowed only his friends to pass. Thus the
_habitants_ had only the fringes of the trade with the Indians. He
still encouraged the _coureurs de bois_ and had fitted out a great
number of them. His avidity is thus described: "He has been seen
filling barrels of brandy with his own hands and mixing it with water
to sell to the Indians. He bartered with one of them his hat, sword,
coat, ribbons, shoes and stockings and boasted that he had made thirty
_pistoles_ by the bargain, while the Indian walked about town equipped
as 'governor.'" It is further stated that last year his commerce was
valued at 40,000 _livres_. In his reply in March, 1682, to the above
mémoire, he states that he has made little trade since, the result
of his business transactions reaching only 13,325 _livres_. The money
of the country being the beaver, trading in peltry was one of the
necessities of life. He continued to have troubles with the seminary
and in August, 1682, he was removed during the first year of M. de La
Barre's governorship and given the government of Acadia!

Trade at Montreal was prospering. In 1674 the West India Company,
which had fulfilled none of its obligations, was suppressed, being
succeeded by that of Oudiette and others, till 1707. Speaking of this
period, Garneau (I, 262) in his "Histoire du Canada" says: "The new
impulses which had been given to Canada by Colbert and Talon began
to bear fruits. Commerce revived, immigration increased and the
natives, dominated by the genius of civilization, feared and respected
everywhere the power of France."

Montreal was to share in this prosperity. It was the centre of the
fur trade and the starting place and base of expeditions such as the
one of Joliet and Marquette, who had set out in 1673 to discover the
Mississippi. La Salle frequently made Montreal his home at this period,
as well as Duluth. At the east corner of the present Royal Insurance
Building on the Place d'Armes, a tablet placed by the Antiquarian
Society records the dwelling of another explorer: "Here lived in 1675
Daniel de Greysolon, Sieur Duluth, one of the explorers of the Upper
Mississippi, after whom the city of Duluth was named."

Meanwhile, on May 18th, Father Marquette died on the west shores of
Michigan. In 1776 the "Place du Marché" was granted by the seigneurs
of the seminary to the people. It was situated where now stands the
Place Royale and faced the historic landing place of the first pioneers
arriving with de Maisonneuve. The growing trade needed a regular market
and on this site subsequently were held the annual fairs in June,
the first recorded being held in 1680. The picturesque description
of Francis Parkman in his "Old Régime in Canada," dealing with this
period, may be here introduced:

"To induce the Indians to come to the colonists, in order that the fur
trade might be controlled by the government, a great annual fair was
established, by order of the king, at Montreal. Thither every summer a
host of savages came down from the lakes in their bark canoes. A place
was assigned them a little distance from the town. They landed, and
drew up their canoes in a line up the bank, took out their packs of
beaver skins, set up their wigwams, slung their kettles and encamped
for the night.

"On the next day there was a grand council on the common, between St.
Paul street and the river. Speeches were made amid a solemn smoking of
pipes. The governor was usually present, seated in an armchair, while
the visitors formed a ring about him, ranged in the order of their
tribe. On the next day the trade began in the same place. Merchants
of high and low degree brought up their goods from Quebec, and every
inhabitant of Montreal of any substance, sought a share in the profits.
Their booths were set up along the palisades of the town and each had
an interpreter to whom he usually promised a certain portion of his
gains. The scene abounded in those contrasts, which mark the whole
course of French Canadian history. Here was a throng of Indians, armed
with bows and arrows, war clubs, and the cheap guns of the trade, some
of them, completely naked, except for the feathers on their heads and
the paint on their faces; French bush rangers, tricked out with savage
finery; merchants and _habitants_ in their coarse and plain attire, and
the grave priests of St. Sulpice robed in black."

In June, 1676, Monseigneur Laval, on his return from France as bishop
of Quebec, visited Montreal to receive postulants into the new
religious communicants of the "Congregation," which approved by him in
1669 and later confirmed by royal letters, was now confirmed by him
in an authentic act, shortly after his arrival at Quebec--but whose
rules were still to be examined and approved, which did not occur until
January 24, 1698. Historians date from the above epoch the adoption of
the religious habit, worn by the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre
Dame to this day. In order to prepare her rules wisely Marguerite
Bourgeoys determined to go to France for advice and experience, having
been previously elected as the first superior. The opportunity was
offered her in November as a companion to the wife of the governor,
Madame Perrot, who had been advised to go to France for the good of
her health. On her return she was followed to Montreal by Louis Frins,
the servant of M. de Maisonneuve, who had died in Paris on September
9, 1676, as well as by several young girls, who were sent out to the
colony at the expense of the seminary.

In 1676 the Mountain Mission was commenced.[128] To encourage the Indians
to settle with the Europeans, various attempts had already been made.
This nomadic people could not be civilized as long as the trail, by the
lakes and rivers and through the forest, called them to the pursuit
of the chase or the lust of battle. Thus we have seen the Jesuits
had already formed their Christian Indian settlements at Madeleine
la Prairie on the south shore across the St. Lawrence. But now the
Sulpicians would do the same on the island, on the slope of Mount
Royal, and today the site of Montreal College, on Sherbrooke Street,
with its old-time Martello towers, marks the scene of the Mountain
Mission. Quarrels had arisen among the chiefs at La Prairie and thus
the dissentients joined the Christian band at the mountain, while the
La Prairie Mission was transferred to the Sault St. Louis, known as the
Caughnawaga Reservation. By 1681, it was determined to conduct schools
for the children of redskins, and M. François Vachon de Belmont,
who came as a deacon to Canada in this year, was named director of
the boys' school. That for the girls was to be under the care of
the Sisters of the Congregation. Marguerite Bourgeoys says that the
Mountain Mission was the first place on the island where the Indians
came for instruction. On arriving, M. de Belmont began to build a
little chapel, dedicated to Notre Dame des Neiges, and a straggling
village of a few irregularly built bark huts clustered round it. In
these lived the missionaries and the sisters, and round them were the
wigwams of their neophytes, Huron and Iroquois. Fearing attack from the
non-Christian tribes, M. de Belmont, a priest since September 14, 1681,
had built by 1685 a palisade surrounding his settlement which boasted
of four bastions. These fortifications were gradually strengthened.
The schools were soon in operation. "In the Mountain Mission and that
of the Sault de la Prairie de la Madeleine (Sault St. Louis); in those
of Sillery and Lorette, the only Indian villages we have, boys are now
being taught to read and write. In the Mountain Mission of Montreal
the Congregation nuns apply themselves to the instruction of the
little girls and make them do needle work," is the description of M.
Duchesneau in a letter to the minister of finance, dated November 13,
1681. Later on these children were taught to knit, spin and do lace
work, the government providing grants of money for women to instruct
them. In 1685 Monseigneur de St. Vallier, Laval's successor, visited
the Mountain Mission and gave this account of its success: "The
daughters of the Congregation, now spread over the different parts of
Canada, have in the Mountain Mission a school of about forty Indian
girls, whom they clothe and bring up 'à la Française.' They are also
taught the mysteries of faith, manual labour, the hymns and prayers of
the church, not only in their own tongue, but also in ours, that they
may be brought little by little to our manners and customs."

[Illustration: 1694

Two old watch towers built in 1694 by M. de Belmont, a Sulpician
Missionary at the "Mountain Fort." In the western tower Marguerite
Bourgeoys taught the Indian children. In the eastern tower, which was
used afterward as a chapel, an Indian brave and his grandchild are
buried. These towers still stand on Sherbrooke Street, West, in the
grounds of the Grand Seminary.]

Two of the Indian maidens of the Mountain Mission stand out, Marie
Barbe Attontinon and Marie Thérèse Gannensagouas. Both were received
into the congregation community. The latter was one of the first pupils
of the mission, receiving baptism on the 28th of June, 1681, at the age
of fourteen, and was a teacher in the mission until her saintly death
at the age of twenty-seven.

The chapel at Caughnawaga preserves the bones of the holy Mohawk
maiden, Catherine Tekakwitha, born in 1656 of an Iroquois father, a
pagan, and an Algonquin mother, a Christian, who both died in her
infancy. On Holy Wednesday, 1678, she died, leaving behind her the
reputation of sanctity. The anniversary of "La bonne Catherine" is kept
each year with great devotion by the Caughnawaga Indians. Charlevoix,
the historian, speaking of the appearance of the face of this holy
maiden, says: "Nothing could be more beautiful, but with that beauty,
which the love of virtue inspires. The people were never weary of
gazing at her." The latter's grandfather, the warrior, François
Thoronhiongo, who had been baptized by the Martyr Jesuit, Père de
Brébeuf, lived at the Mountain Mission. In 1824 the east Martello
tower, now standing on Sherbrooke Street, wherein the Sisters of the
Congregation had lived while teaching, was transferred into a chapel
and the bodies of the grandfather and grandchild, which had rested
there since 1796, were allowed to remain. The tower on the west was a
school for the Indian girls. These towers, still remaining, are all
that is left to mark the site of the Priests' Fort and Jacques Viger's
manuscripts tell us that this fort was so called to distinguish it from
the enclosure next to it and which, being surrounded by a palisade,
was known as "The Indian's Fort." Both structures formed part of the
same outwork and are mentioned under the common title of "The Mountain
Fort." The Priests' Fort was built in 1694 by the Sulpician, François
Vachon de Belmont, at his own expense. It was, first a square enclosed
by a stone wall with portholes and flanked by a tower at each angle;
secondly, the fort proper or manor, in the middle of the enclosure
where the missionaries lived; thirdly, the chapel which was opposite
the manor and between the two towers. In 1844 the erection of the vast
edifice now used as a college and as a seminary was begun on this very
site. The two towers still standing and the wall connecting them are
over two hundred years old and are after the Seminary of St. Sulpice
on Notre Dame Street the oldest building in Montreal. Long may the
towers stand as sentinels guarding the traditions of the past!... The
Sulpicians accompanied the Indians when the mission was transplanted to
Sault-au-Récollet and thence later to the Lake of the Two Mountains.

Leaving the Mountain Mission whose commencement we have placed in 1676
and traversing the streets down town, we notice the unpaved state
of the streets. In this year, 1676, an ordinance stipulated that
proprietors should pave to the middle of the roadway every street
passing in front of their dwellings. But it seems that up to the
cession, these regulations had fallen into desuetude.

The year of 1678 saw great preparations at Montreal for new ventures
on the part of La Salle and Duluth, in which the governor general was
reported by Intendant Duchesneau to be commercially interested. In
July, 1678, La Salle left France armed with a royal patent allowing
him "to build forts through which it would seem that a passage to
Mexico can be found." He had made good friends in France since his
previous visit in 1674 and found financial supporters, "bringing with
him about thirty artisans and labourers, with much of the gearing and
equipment necessary for rigging a vessel, including anchors, with the
usual assortment of the articles required for his intercourse with the
Indians." With him was Henri de Tonti, an Italian officer, who was to
prove a most devoted and loyal lieutenant to La Salle. At the siege of
Gaëta, de Tonti had had a hand blown off and it was now replaced with
a metal substitute, which, though covered with a glove, could deal a
heavy blow, as the surprised Indians afterwards learned. A third was
with them, the Sieur de la Motte. Arriving at Quebec on September
15th, La Salle was shortly afterwards joined by the Recollect Father,
Hennepin, eager to explore the Mississippi.

While at Quebec, La Salle was named one of the twenty commissioners,
then sitting to investigate the murders and other crimes reported to
have arisen during the past six years from the use of liquors. In
consequence, the old dispute was arising again as to the propriety of
preventing liquors being taken to the Indians, to encourage traffic
with the French instead of the Dutch. It was urged that the fur trade
would leave Montreal for Albany, as beaver skins, if they got there,
would fetch a higher price. For prohibition, were Laval and the
Intendant Duchesneau, whilst against it was Frontenac backed up by
Colbert, who supported Talon, one of whose last actions in Canada had
been to permit the use of spirits as an article of commerce. The report
of the commission to France was in favour of the traffic in spirits as
necessary for the support of the fur trade, which was the one source
of wealth for the country. M. Laval started for France with a counter
memorial. Finally a compromise was arranged to the effect that strong
liquors might not be taken to the woods openly, and if clandestinely,
punishment was to follow. But as liquor was permitted in the houses of
the French and those houses could be built anywhere, the law was easily
evaded, so that in reality liquor became to be recognized currency in
the trade for fur.

Shortly after the above event La Salle left Montreal, doubtless with
a good supply of "eau de vie," for his fief, Mount Cataracqui, and in
the second week of November he started thence to make his way to the
Mississippi, returning at intervals to Montreal for supplies. At last
after thrilling and hazardous adventures La Salle and his men reached
the mouth of the Mississippi, where he declared the basin of the river
to be the territory of Louis the Great and named it Louisiana. All
honour to Montreal, the fruitful home of discoverers!

David Greysolon du Luth left Montreal on the 1st of September, 1678,
with seven Frenchmen on a similar adventure. It was he who built the
fort at the entrance of the Kaministiquia, Lake Superior, known under
Hudson Bay rule as Fort William, and who strove persistently to foil
the rival English traders of this company. He was a man equally at
home in camp, in society, or in the Indian wigwams--a type of the many
roving adventurers, fighters, traders and explorers, whom Canada was
then alluring and who were little removed from the _coureurs de bois_,
at whom so many ordinances were leveled, but whose number was steadily
increasing.[129]

Meanwhile relations had become more and more strained between Frontenac
and Duchesneau. As early as 1676 the troubles began with the questions
of precedence and of the degrees of courtesy that should be paid to
the governor and the intendant. On May 1, 1677, Colbert wrote to the
intendant warning him not to take sides against the governor and on May
18th he wrote to the governor exhorting him to live amicably with the
intendant. On April 30, 1681, the king wrote to Frontenac complaining
of his arbitrary conduct and threatening to recall him unless he mended
his ways. He was accused of being too lenient with the _coureurs de
bois_ and in consequence the king ordered that whoever went to the
woods without a license should be branded and whipped for the first
offence, and sent to the galleys for life, for the second.

Every ship to France carried complaints from Duchesneau and Frontenac
against one another. The rivalry was intense. The last official act
of Frontenac in the _Registre du Conseil Supérieur_ is a formal
declaration that his rank in that body is superior to the intendant's.
Finally the untenable position was relieved by the king, who recalled
them by an act of May 1st. Before leaving and early in the August of
this year Frontenac was at Montreal to meet the Ottawas and the Hurons
on their yearly descent from the lakes and there he met the famous
Huron Iroquois chief, the Rat, and at a solemn council succeeded in
averting, for the time, the war then brewing about Michillimackinac,
when the Illinois and some of the tribes of the lakes were in likely
danger of speedy and complete destruction at the hands of the Iroquois.
This would have been fatal to the trade of Canada.

Shortly afterwards, Frontenac sailed for France, leaving Canada when
he was most needed. When he sailed, "it was a day of rejoicing to more
than half of the merchants of Canada" (who were not in his ring), says
Parkman ("Frontenac," p. 71), "and excepting the Recollects, to all the
priests; but he left behind him an impression, very general among the
people, that if danger threatened the colony, Count Frontenac was the
man for the hour."

Montreal was no little concerned with this division between the
disputants, for whereas the merchants, traders and _habitants_ over the
country took sides with either party, those of Montreal, such as Le
Moyne and his sons, Jacques LeBer, and left many more of the leading
men sided with Duchesneau, while Perrot, the local governor, seems
to have come to a mutual understanding with Frontenac and carried on
illicit trade as before. "Frontenac had," as the intendant wrote to
the minister on November 16, 1679, "gradually made himself master of
the trade of Montreal; as soon as the Indians arrived, he sets guard
in his camp, which would be very well, if these soldiers did their
duty and protected the savages from being annoyed and plundered by
the French, instead of being employed to discover how many furs they
have brought with a view to future operations. Monsieur, the governor,
then compels the Indians to pay his guards for protecting them; and he
has never allowed them to trade with the inhabitants till they have
first given him a certain number of packs of beaver skins, which he
calls his presents. His guards trade with them openly at the fair,
with their bandoliers on their shoulders." Moreover, Duchesneau in the
same communication accused Frontenac of sending up goods to Montreal
to be traded in his behalf, so that with the presents exacted and his
trading, only little ever reached the people of the colony of what the
Indians brought to market. It is only fair to add that Frontenac made
similar charges against the intendant for engaging in trade. Meanwhile
partisan spirit ran high and the streets of Quebec and Montreal
witnessed brawls such as those between the Capulets and Montagues
of Romeo and Juliet. "A plague on both your houses!" The Count de
Frontenac and the Intendant Duchesneau were respectively replaced on
May 1, 1680, by M. de La Barre and M. de Meulles, although they did not
enter upon their functions until Friday, October 9th, of the same year.


NOTE

A writer who visited Quebec in 1683 in his "Memoirs of North America"
tells us that the merchant who had carried on the greatest trade in
Canada was the Sieur Samuel Bernon of Rochel, who had great warehouses
at Quebec, from which the inhabitants of the other towns were supplied
with such commodities as they wanted.

"There is no difference," he says, "between the pirates that scour
the seas and the Canada merchants, unless it be this, that the former
sometimes enrich themselves all of a sudden by a good prize; and the
latter cannot make their fortune without trading for five or six
years, and that, without running the hazard of their lives. I have
known twenty little peddlers that had not above a thousand crowns stock
when I arrived at Quebec in the year 1683, and when I left that place,
had got to the tune of 12,000 crowns. It is an unquestioned truth that
they get 50 per cent upon all goods they deal in, whether they buy
them up, upon the arrival of the ships at Quebec, or have them from
France by way of commissions: but over and above that, there are some
gaudy trinkets, such as ribbands, laces, embroideries, tobacco-boxes,
watches, and an infinity of other baubles of iron ware, upon which they
get 150 per cent, all costs clear.

"As soon as the French ships arrive at Quebec the merchants of that
city, who have their factors in other towns, load their barks with
goods in order to transport them to these other towns. Such merchants
as act for themselves at Trois Rivières, or Montreal, come down in
person to Quebec to market for themselves, and then put their effects
on board of barks to be conveyed home. If they pay for their goods in
skins, they buy cheaper than if they made their payments in money or
letters of exchange; by reason that the seller gets considerably by the
skins, when he returns to France. Now you must take notice, that all
these skins are bought up from the inhabitants, or from the savages,
upon which the merchants are considerable gainers. To give you an
instance of this matter, a person that lives in the neighbourhood of
Quebec, carries a dozen of marten skins, five or six fox skins, and as
many skins of wild cats, to a merchant's house, in order to sell them
for woolen cloth, linen, arms, ammunition, etc. In the trade of those
skins, the merchant draws a double profit, one upon the score of his
paying no more for these skins than one-half of what he afterwards
sells them for, in the lump, to the factors, for the Rochel ships; and
the other, by the exorbitant rate he puts upon the goods which the poor
planter takes in exchange for his skins. If this be duly weighed, we
will not think it strange that these merchants have a more beneficial
trade than a great many tradesmen in the world."--Canadian Antiquarian
and Numismatic Journal, 1872, p. 130.


FOOTNOTES:

[128] Some authors have supposed that the Mountain Mission began as
early as 1657, but this appears impossible, when we recollect that for
twenty-seven years or more settlers scarcely dared to leave the town
for fear of the Iroquois, who tracked them to their very doorsteps!
Moreover, the first registrations of the Mountain Mission date from
1688, and, note, that all previous baptisms had been set down in the
Ville Marie registre. The latter before 1677 makes no mention of the
aforesaid mission. (Cf. Note by Mary Drummond in the "Life and Times of
Marguerite Bourgeoys.")

[129] In 1680 Duchesneau reported on November 13th the population
of Canada at 9,400; of this number there were five or six hundred
coureurs de bois. "There is not a family," wrote the Intendant, "of any
condition or quality soever, who have not children, brothers, uncles
and nephews among them."

The recall of Frontenac had great influence on La Salle's career, for
the new governor, de La Barre, an aged man wanting in firmness and
decision, intended to enrich himself[130] and had accordingly connected
himself with a clique of merchants in the colony, intent on the
monopoly of the western fur trade. He believed in their representations
that by acting with them, he would be enabled to obtain large profits.
The principals in this arrangement were Aubert de la Chesnaye, Jacques
Leber and Charles Le Moyne, the latter two of Montreal.

Accordingly, when on April 3, 1683, after hearing that his protector,
Frontenac, had sailed for France, La Salle wrote the new governor,
telling of his success in the expedition to the mouth of the
Mississippi, and dwelling on the necessity of establishing colonists
along the route which he had opened, and asked that such of his men
as were sent to Montreal for supplies should not be arrested, he
little knew how poorly his exploration was valued by the governor. In
a second letter he speaks of the threatened rising of the Iroquois in
the Michillimackinac district, and of the danger he was in, at his Fort
St. Louis, on the River Illinois, on the top of "Starved Rock" (as it
was afterwards called after Pontiac's war in 1764), with but twenty
men, and only 100 pounds of powder. He asks that his men should not
be detained, as he was in need of reinforcements; likewise, that no
seizure of his property in Montreal should be permitted as he was in
want of munitions and supplies.

No supplies were sent him and his men were made prisoners in Montreal
as transgressors of the law. Moreover, on pretense that the conditions,
on which his fort at Frontenac had been granted, had not been carried
out, the governor sent Leber and de la Chesnaye to seize it in the
royal name. La Salle determined to appeal in person to the minister
in France and coming down the lakes he met the Chevalier de Baugis,
who had been sent by de La Barre to seize his Fort St. Louis. In the
next year, 1684, the king wrote to the governor and the intendant, de
Moules, commanding them to make restitution to La Salle for the injury
done him at Fort Frontenac and Fort St. Louis.

Hardly had La Barre arrived in Canada than he learned of the
declaration of war by the Iroquois against the Illinois, the allies of
the French. A deliberation of the highest in the land resulted in a
request to the king for help to restrain the Iroquois, which brought
the promise of a convoy of 200 soldiers to be sent without delay from
France! Wishing, however, to compromise with the Iroquois and to make
peace rather than war which would damage his personal trade relations
at Cataracqui, the governor sent Charles Le Moyne as envoy to Onondaga
to invite a deputation of their chiefs to visit Montreal. This was
fixed for June, but it was not till August that a meagre delegation
from but five cantons arrived, and the grand council was held in the
newly built church of Montreal.

Parkman tells the story thus: "Presents were given to the deputies
(forty-three Iroquois chiefs) to the value of more than two thousand
crowns. Soothing speeches were made them and they were urged not
to attack the tribes of the lakes, nor to plunder French traders,
_without permission_. They assented and La Barre then asked, timidly,
why they made war on the Illinois. 'Because they deserve to die,'
haughtily returned the Iroquois orator. La Barre dared not answer.
They complained that La Salle had given guns, powder and lead to the
Illinois; or in other words, that he had helped the allies of the
colony to defend themselves. La Barre, who hated La Salle and his
monopolies, assured them that he should be punished. It is affirmed on
good authority that he said more than this, and told them that they
were welcome to plunder and kill him. The rapacious old man was playing
with a two-edged sword." ("Frontenac," p. 84).

Montreal that summer witnessed the preparations of La Barre and
his 200 men, who left Quebec on July 10th ostensibly to fight the
Iroquois around Fort Frontenac; among them was de la Chesnaye. The
new intendant, Jacques de Meulles, Sieur de la Source, grieving no
doubt that he had to finance this new war, has the lowest opinion of
this enterprise and writes to the minister (July 8-11): "In a word,
Monseigneur, this war has been decided upon in the cabinet of monsieur,
the general (La Barre) along with six of the chief merchants of the
country," and in a postscript he added, "I will finish this letter,
Monseigneur, by telling you that he set out yesterday, July 10th, with
a detachment of 200 men. All Quebec was filled with grief to see him
embark on an expedition of war, _tête à tête_ with the man La Chesnaye.
Everybody says that the war is a sham, that these two will arrange
everything between them and in a word do whatever will help their
trade. The whole country is in despair to see how matters are managed."
(Quoted by Parkman, "Frontenac," p. 103.)

After a long stay at Montreal the little army of 130 regular soldiers,
700 Canadians and 200 savages, principally Iroquois from Caughnawaga
and Hurons from Lorette near Quebec, embarked at Lachine. The party
from Montreal landed under the palisades of Fort Frontenac or
Cataracqui, on a low, damp plain and became the victims of a malarial
fever of which the men sickened. On the 3d of September Le Moyne was
sent to La Famine at the mouth of the Salmon River, bringing with
him the wily and astute orator of the Iroquois, Big Mouth, Latinized
by La Hontan, who was present, as "Grangula." At the council which
followed at La Famine, whither La Barre with such of his men who were
well enough to move, had crossed to meet the Iroquois in their own
territory, Big Mouth had all the honours and the ending was humiliating
for the French. He declared the Iroquois could fight the Illinois to
the death, and La Barre dared not utter a word in behalf of his allies.
"He promised to decamp," says Parkman, "and set out for home on the
following morning, being satisfied with the promise that the Iroquois
would repair the damage done the French traders in the war against the
Illinois--a promise never realized. La Barre embarked and hastened
home in advance of his men. His camp was again full of the sick. Their
comrades placed them, shivering with ague fits, on board the flatboats
and canoes; and the whole force, scattered and disordered, floated
down the current to Montreal. Nothing had been gained but a thin and
flimsy peace, with new troubles and dangers plainly visible behind it."
("Frontenac," p. 111).

At Montreal, as a consequence of this disease-stricken expedition, the
Hôtel-Dieu was filled with the sick, as was that of Quebec. The end
was humiliating to La Barre; the honour was with the Iroquois and the
Illinois allies had been shamefully abandoned. The treaty of La Famine
was received by the colony with contumely and shortly afterwards the
inefficient governor received his recall, polite, but unmistakable in
its import.

On November 14th, Monseigneur de Laval left for France, sixty-one years
of age, but broken down by his austere duties and unremitting labours.
He attended the Sovereign Council on August 28th, and fought against
the making of the secular clergy into "irremovable curés"--a policy
which has been continued to this day. On November 2d, he established
the Chapter of Quebec Cathedral, consisting of twelve canons and four
chaplains. He came back to Quebec again on August 15, 1688, and took
up his quarters at his beloved seminary founded by him, not any longer
with the burdens and honours of the Episcopate, but as a simple retired
prelate, the father-in-God of his seminarists--till nearly his death on
May 6, 1708. He was a man who was a sign for contradiction to many, yet
always firm, zealous, unbending and of upright principles, which even
his enemies recognized, though they might have quailed before him and
have withstood him.

De Meulles still continued as intendant, not being recalled till 1686.
He was endowed with much initiative and executive ability, which La
Barre wanted, so that he nearly brought the country to ruin. After the
disgraceful treaty with the Iroquois, on September 4th, de Meulles
found that the drain on the exchequer was so great that he was at his
wits' end to pay the soldiers who belonged to "le détachement in French
de la marine"--in spite of the name, purely a land body, supported
by the department "of the marine," there being no colonial office to
France. This detachment was organized in France about the year 1682,
from among the disbanded soldiers who had taken part in the Dutch
or other wars, to protect the inhabitants of New France from the
relentless raids of ever-roving bands of ruthless Iroquois, which had
become so persistent as almost to paralyze the agricultural pursuits as
well as the trade and commerce of the country.

How was the intendant, de Meulles, to pay these soldiers? There was
little or no coin currency. Beaver skins and wheat were legal tender,
but very bulky and very inconvenient for small accounts. The dearth
of currency may be explained as follows: In New France currency
difficulties had always prevailed because any few doles of coin that
came from the home government were returned as remittances by the
importers as the balance of trade was always against the colony and
therefore exchange was necessarily high. In 1670 a special coinage of
15 and 5 _sol_ pieces of silver and _doubles_ in copper were struck at
Paris and sent out with a proviso that they should not be circulated in
the mother country. But notwithstanding this interdiction these also
were sent as remittances. Thus there was little or no coin currency in
the country with which to trade. The ready witted intendant therefore
invented the pioneer paper money, which originally circulated in the
form of a note, on the back of an ordinary playing card signed by de
Meulles, in 1685. It was the beginning of the paper money which is
now so largely used all over the world. De Meulles hit upon the plan
of using whole, or cutting up, ordinary playing cards into halves or
quarters, with the word "_bon_" inserted on each, for a certain sum,
signed and sealed in wax with his own hand and countersigned by the
clerk of the treasury as they were issued. This emergency card money is
claimed by Mr. R. W. McLachlan as the first regular paper money issued
in any Caucasian nation. He claims that the Massachusetts paper money,
issued first five years after that of Canada, for the similar purpose
of paying soldiers, was an imitation.

[Illustration: CARD MONEY]

A new supply of these cards was issued in October, 1711. The old issue
disappeared and there is not one left even for antiquarian collections.
Further issues were made in 1714 and 1717, but in this latter year the
total withdrawal of the old cards was ordered. By 1720 these cards had
all been redeemed by the government.

In 1721 a copper currency was struck for the colony at the mint of
La Rochelle and Rouen of nine denier pieces. Though issued with a
proclamation throughout New France they were never acceptable to the
Canadians and were at last withdrawn. There was then after the issue
of the cards of 1717 a lull of about ten years, when in 1729 recourse
was again had to the convenient paper money, but the playing card was
superseded by a plain white card with clipped edges and with various
other changes in stamps and signatures. This system was continued until
Intendant Bigot's time and the fall of New France. The inventory of
Jacques LeBer of Montreal, dated June 7, 1735, showing coins to the
value of 84 _livres_ 8 _sols_ 3 _deniers_, and card money to the value
of 2833.3.0, indicates the early predominance of card money. About 1750
Bigot introduced, as a new currency, an unauthorized note called an
"ordonnance," which, unlike the card issue, did not seek the governor's
approval by seal or signature. They were more than twice as large, on
forms printed in France on ordinary writing paper, with blank spaces
for filling in the amount, the date, and number in writing. These
"ordonnances" were orders on the treasury of Quebec or, in the case
of the fall of the capital, of Montreal, which could pass as cash and
were redeemable in bulk, either in card money, or by drafts on the
treasurer of the marine in France. This method afforded ample scope for
peculation both from the government and the people. At first Bigot's
issue of "ordonnances" was slight but by the end of the French régime,
it exceeded 80,000,000 _livres_ or nearly $14,000,000. This was a large
sum for an impoverished country to refund. It was years after it was
redeemed and some never so by the French Government, after the fall of
the French régime in Canada. The cards and "ordonnances" were a drug
on the market for many years pending redemption, so that the original
holders gained very little. The introduction of specie did much to
reconcile the French to the British régime.[131]


1685

La Barre's successor was the Marquis of Denonville, a pious colonel
of dragoons, who had seen much active service, and who could act when
occasion required with firmness and vigour. In the same boat with him
and his wife there arrived at Quebec in the beginning of August, 1685,
Laval's successor, the bishop-elect, the young, impetuous, zealous and
rigid Monseigneur de Saint-Vallier--and a lasting friendship was then
cemented. Denonville's instructions ordered him to uphold the allies
of France, to humiliate the Iroquois and to establish peace on a solid
basis. He was to spare no effort to maintain a good understanding
with the English but should they and the Iroquois be allied in their
battles, they were to be treated as enemies. On the 6th of August he
presided at the Sovereign Council. After staying a short time at Quebec
he went to Montreal and there set up the Chevalier de Callières, a
former captain of the Navarre Regiment, as the governor in place of M.
Perrot, who had been sent to Acadia (being appointed in 1684), where as
governor he pursued the same tactics as at Montreal and was replaced in
1687. Denonville's reign with the English and the Iroquois was stormy,
but he was singularly peaceful in his relations with the bishop, the
intendant and the governor of Montreal.

[Illustration: MGR. J. B. DE LA CROIX CHEVRIERES DE SAINT-VALLIER]

[Illustration: MARQUIS JACQUES-RENE DE BRISAY DENONVILLE]

A gloomy picture of Canadian life, which applies equally to Montreal,
was sent by Denonville to France in his letters of August 20, September
3 and November 12, 1685. "The youths," he says, "are so badly trained
that the moment they are able to shoulder a gun their fathers dare not
speak reprovingly to them. They do not take kindly to labour, having
no occupation but hunting; they prefer the life of the _coureur de
bois_, where there is no curé or father to restrain them, and in which
they adopt the life of the Indian even to going about naked. The life
has great attractions for them, for on carnival days and other days of
feasting and debauchery they imitate the Indian in all things, their
company being frequently lawless and unruly. The noblesse of Canada
is in a condition of extreme poverty. To increase their number is to
multiply a class of lounging idlers. The sons of the councillors are
not more industrious than the other youths. The men are tall, well
made, well set up, robust, active, accustomed to live on little.
They are wayward, lightminded and inclined to debauchery but have
intelligence and veracity; the women and girls, pretty, but idle from
want of occupation in the minor work of the sex.

"Nothing," says Denonville, "can be finer or better conceived than the
regulations formed for the government of this country; but nothing,
I assure you, is so ill-observed as regards both the fur trade and
the general discipline of the colony. One great evil is the infinite
number of drinking shops, which makes it almost impossible to remedy
the disorders resulting from them. All the rascals and idlers of the
country are attracted to this business of tavern keeping. They never
dream of tilling the soil, but on the contrary they deter the other
inhabitants from it, and end with ruining them. I know seignories
where there are but twenty houses, and more than half of them dram
shops. At Three Rivers there are twenty-five houses and liquor may be
had at eighteen or twenty of them. Ville Marie (Montreal) and Quebec
are on the same footing. The villages governed by the Jesuits and
Sulpicians are models. Drunkenness there is not seen. But it is sad to
see the ignorance of the population at a distance from the abodes of
the _curés_, who are put to the greatest trouble to remedy the evils,
traveling from place to place through the parishes in their charges."
(Denonville au ministre, Parkman, "Old Régime," pp. 375-6-7; vide,
résumé of Kingsford, I, 65.)

The clergy, however, did their work manfully and unflinchingly and
it was their devotion to their work of upbuilding the morality and
character of the French Canadians that assured them the prestige
which is enjoyed by them to this day. Bishop St. Vallier confirms
Denonville, La Barre, Duchesneau and other contemporary writers when
he says that, "the Canadian youths are for the most part demoralized,"
and although previously, in 1688, he had written very favourably on
the religious state of Canada, in a pastoral mandate of October 31,
1690, he says: "Before we first knew our flock we thought that the
English and the Iroquois were the only wolves we had to fear; but God
having opened our eyes to the disorders of this diocese and made us
feel more and more the weight of our charge, we are forced to confess
that our most dangerous foes are drunkenness, impurity, and slander."
The Canadian drank hard and many a man was old at forty. "But," says
Parkman ("Old Régime," p. 378), "nevertheless the race did not die out.
The prevalence of early marriages and the birth of numerous offspring
before the vigour of the father had been wasted ensured the strength
and hardihood which characterized the Canadians." Bishop St. Vallier
soon visited Montreal and his description of the mountain settlement we
have already given.

Here we may add a scathing picture which occurs in the ordinance of
Monseigneur Jean Baptiste de Saint-Vallier, dated October 22, 1686,
touching modesty and the want of veneration in the churches. It may
justly apply to the Montreal ladies of the period, since it complains,
"of the luxury and the vanity reigning, throughout _the whole country_
among the girls and grown-up women, with more licence and scandal than
ever. They are not content to have on them habits, the price and style
of which are much above the means or the condition of life of those
wearing them, but they affect moreover immodest head-dresses within
and without their homes, and often even in the churches, leaving heads
uncovered or only decked with a transparent veil and with an assemblage
of ribbons, lace work, curls and other vanities. But what is still more
to be deplored, and what pierces our soul with sorrow, is that they
have no difficulty in rendering themselves the instruments of the demon
and in cooperating with the loss of souls, bought by the blood of
Jesus Christ, by uncovering the _nudités_ of their neck and shoulders,
the sight of which makes an infinite number of persons to fall." The
good bishop might be similarly shocked if he visited Montreal today.[132]

In the spring of 1685, M. de Callières, the governor of Montreal,
employed 600 men under the direction of M. du Luth, royal engineer,
to erect a palisade around the town.[133] It was made of wood stakes
furnished by the citizens and had to be constantly repaired. This
palisade, with curtains and bastions, was 13 feet in height and there
were five gates, those of Lachine, the Recollects, the Port, St. Martin
and St. Lawrence; and five posterns, de Maricourt, the barracks, the
General Hospital, the Hôtel-Dieu and de Callières.

About this time there was apparently laxity in the retention of
arms. For one cause or another many households were very scantily
accommodated, through sale or truck, or on account of seizure for debt.
Accordingly a notice of the supreme council was affixed to the door of
the parish church of Montreal by the sergeant, Quesneville, on February
18, 1686. After emphasizing the importance of the obligation which the
Marquis de Denonville had laid upon every house-holder in the colony of
being well armed, the council forbade all persons of whatever quality
or condition to deprive themselves of their arms by sale or otherwise,
unless they had weapons beyond what was necessary, to arm each father
of the family, and his children and domestics, who shall have attained
to the age of fourteen years; it forbade all "huissiers and sergeants
of justice to seize these arms, all tavern keepers and others to buy
them, or truck them, under penalties named."

With Denonville's advent as the representative of Louis XIV, the
struggle for supremacy between Canada and the English, under Thomas
Dongan, the Irish Catholic governor of New York representing James II,
of England, began to assume warlike proportions. The English of New
York were laying claim to the whole country south of the Great Lakes
and were anxious to control the great western fur trade. The northern
fur trade was being bid for by the Hudson's Bay Company, and the
fisheries of New Acadia were being seized upon by the New Englanders.
In the regions of Michillimackinac the English were striving to
alienate the Hurons, Ottawas and other like tribes; they had already
on their side, the Iroquois, whose arrogance to the French, especially
that of the Senecas, was so galling that it seemed necessary for French
prestige to humble them. Such were de Denonville's instructions. This
was one of the reasons why he wished to build his fort at Niagara
as early as May, 1685--a project highly displeasing to Dongan--to
counteract the English desire for the same purpose, namely to obtain
supremacy over the tribes in that direction and to be masters of the
trade, for that was what most mattered.[134]

This was de Denonville's motive also for his projected forts at
Toronto, or Lake Erie, and that at Détroit, for which latter enterprise
he commissioned du Luth of Montreal. The intense rivalry showed itself
in 1686 in the organized attempt of the French to dispute the supremacy
claimed by the Hudson's Bay Company, then in its infancy, on the
western shore of that dreary inland sea. As so many Montrealers joined
in this effort, it may be recorded more fully than could otherwise be
permitted.

Let us, then, turn to the rivalry existing between the English and
French in Hudson's Bay, represented by the great company of that name
and the Canadian rival body, "La Compagnie du Nord." The English firm
had discovered the bay under Hudson and, with the help of the two
renegade Frenchmen, Médard Chouart des Groseilliers and Pierre Esprit
de Radisson,[135] both well known at Montreal, as bold and unscrupulous
_coureurs de bois_ and fur traders, had formed a company with English
capital from London and had established Fort Nelson near the mouth of
the Nelson River, and then other forts, Albany, Rupert and Monsipi or
Monsoni (Fort Hayes) on the southern end of the bay. But the French had
a grant of the fur industry from Louis XIV and had done some trading
there before the advent of the English. It had been taken possession
of, in 1672, in the name of Louis XIV by the Jesuit Albanel (one of the
early Montreal missionaries) and M. de St. Simon, and the French had
built Fort Thérèse, which, on being taken from them by the English, was
named Fort Nelson.

The French merchants desiring to oust their competitors appealed to
Denonville and he commissioned the Chevalier de Troyes, a captain of
infantry, to chase the English from the bay and retake their own. With
him went the young d'Iberville (then twenty-four years of age) and
his brothers Maricourt and St. Hélène, seventy Canadians and thirty
soldiers, "all," says Ferland, "accustomed to long marches, able to
manage canoes, to withstand the most piercing colds and well versed in
'la petite guerre.'" Their chaplain was the Jesuit Silvy. The party
left Montreal in the month of March, 1686, when the rivers were still
frozen and the snow was on the ground. They mounted the rivers and
lakes on their snowshoes, dragging their provisions, arms and materials
for canoe construction on their sleds, reaching the River Monsipi,
near Fort Hayes, the first English fort, in June or so, which shortly
afterwards fell with Forts Rupert and Albany, largely on account of the
brilliant exploits of d'Iberville, whose reputation was established on
this occasion. The whole expedition lasted only two months.

This brave buccaneering angered the English. A treaty of neutrality
intervening between the two powers of France and England left them
helpless for the moment, but in 1693 the Hudson's Bay Company were
again in possession. In 1697, as we shall see, d'Iberville will again
be in their waters and attacking these forts.

The year 1687 marks the tragic death of La Salle. In 1684 his last
expedition had sailed from La Rochelle directly for the Mississippi,
carrying three priests at least, his brother, the Sulpician, Jean
Cavelier, and the Recollects, Zendbre Membre and Anastase Douay; twelve
gentlemen of France and also soldiers, artisans and labourers, in all
to the number of 144 persons, with a full supply of provisions and
implements. There were four vessels, Le Joly, a frigate of thirty-six
cannons; La Belle, six cannons; St. François, a transport; and
l'Aimable, a fluke of 300 tons. M. de Beaujean, sailing in Le Joly, was
commander of the squadron and La Salle led the land forces.

Disaster after disaster befell the expedition. M. de Beaujean passed
the mouth of the Mississippi without noticing it, it being reserved for
Le Moyne d'Iberville in 1699 to be the first white man to descend it by
the sea. One vessel ran aground, another was captured by the Spaniards,
with those that carried the greater part of the ammunition, implements
and provisions. Beaujean in consequence of serious disagreements with
La Salle returned to France with Le Joly and the luckless explorer
found himself reduced, by these losses and by sickness, to the number
of thirty-six despairing colonists. In this plight La Salle conceived
the plan of reaching Canada on foot. Sixteen of his party consented
to follow him, among them his brother Jean, his nephew Moranget,
the faithful Joutel, du Hault and his servant Larchevêque, Hiens of
Wurtembourg a buccaneer, Ruter Liotot or Lanquetot, the surgeon of the
expedition, Sager and Nika, and the faithful Recollect, Père Douay, who
accompanied La Salle to his last hour.

On March 17, 1687, two months after the departure from the Bay of
Matagorda, on the coast of Texas, which the expedition had reached at
the end of January, the surgeon, Liotot, slew with his axe Moranget,
Sager and Nika. He was but the cowardly executor of the order of a band
of assassins of the rest of the party, consisting of Hiens, Larchevêque
and their leader du Hault. Fearing the vengeance of La Salle, two days
later, the mutineers determined to make away with him, and on March
19th, between the rivers, San Jacinto and La Trinité, Robert René de
Cavelier, at the age of forty-three years and four months, fell a
victim to the musket of the treacherous du Hault.[136]

Joutel, who accompanied the expedition and whom Charlevoix met in Rouen
in 1713 and described as a very honest man and one of the few of his
troop that La Salle could count on, says of his friend in the "_Journal
historique du dernier voyage que feu M. de la Salle fit dans le Golfe
du Mexique, Paris, 1713_," written on the notes taken from 1684-1687:
"Thus unhappily ended the life of M. de la Salle, at the time when he
had all to hope for from his great labours. He had the intelligence
and talent to crown his enterprise with success--firmness, courage, a
great knowledge of sciences and arts, which rendered him capable of
anything, and an indefatigable perseverance which made him surmount
every obstacle. These fine qualities were balanced by too haughty
manners, which made him sometimes unsupportable, and by a harshness
towards those who were under him, which drew upon him their implacable
hatred and was the cause of his death." Ferland (Cours d'Histoire t.
II, p. 172) has a similar judgment. We have different writings on the
death of La Salle: first, the story of Father Douay, the eye witness of
the assassination; he gave the details to Joutel, who was not present
at the moment of the crime; second, "La Relation of the death of Sieur
de la Salle, following the report of one named Couture." This Couture
of Rouen, who had remained with Tonti, had learned the circumstances
of the assassination of La Salle from a Frenchman. This description
shows animosity to La Salle; third, the "Mémoire" of Henry Tonti. The
"Relation" of Abbé Cavelier stops before the death of his brother.

All the assassins perished miserably. Liotot and du Hault died at the
hands of Ruter, a Breton sailor. Hiens and Ruter were also slain by one
of their accomplices. (Parkman, Great West, p. 461.) Larchevêque was
discovered in Texas by the Spaniards and was sent to Mexico to work in
the mines as a galley slave. Père Douay, l'Abbé Cavelier, Joutel and
others finished by arriving at Arkansas and from there they went to
Fort St. Louis on the Illinois.

Thus ended the career of one of the most remarkable men of this
continent. The lights and shades of this man's story are fascinating
but we cannot pursue them. For Montrealers he is interesting in that
he, one of their predecessors, it was who discovered by land the Ohio
and the mouth of the Mississippi, and the vast district of Louisiana,
of which he had taken solemn possession on April 9, 1682, in the name
of Louis XIV. It remained for another Montrealer, Le Moyne d'Iberville,
to build a stockade fort at Biloxi in 1699 to hold the country for the
king, thus laying the first foundations of Louisiana in Mississippi,
which soon saw also the forts of Mobile Bay and Dauphin Island. The
first governors of Louisiana the brothers d'Iberville and de Bienville,
are also proudly remembered as of Montreal origin. It is foreign to
the scope of this history to settle the dispute as to how far La Salle
discovered the Mississippi.[137] But granting that Father Marquette and
Louis Joliet commenced the discovery in 1673, of the upper inland
reaches, its completion to the mouth by land must be conceded to La
Salle, its discovery from the sea having been made a century before by
de Soto.

In many ways La Salle differed very much from the type of men exploring
North America at this time. He had little of the traditional gayety
and insouciance of the leader of _coureurs de bois_; he did not seek,
primarily, wealth or glory; nor is his life marked with any of the
excesses of a scandalous time. This silent and uncommunicative man,
of a hardy and uncommon physiognomy, active in body and restless in
mind, with those powerful and tyrannical instincts, ever latent, which
push strong and energetic natures to the arduous search after the
unknown and the vague was one of those characters that feel the need
of fleeing from society to go out of themselves and to lose themselves
in movement and action. Repose is to them irksome and wearisome. Such
men are the victims of the perpetual tempests agitating them and it is
no wonder that sometimes they break forth impetuously into anger or
brutality against friend or foe alike. Such a one was La Salle; and the
above psychological explanation of his career, it seems, is the key of
understanding to this original personality.

of their proposition to send back to France the women of evil life;

as little hurt as your brandy and in the opinion of Christians is much
more wholesome."

[135] Radisson was in Montreal as early as July, 1657, and frequently
afterwards started his wanderings from Montreal. Other early

[137] According to a recent writer, Pierre d'Esprit Radisson, and
Médard Chouart, Sieur de Groseilliers, of Three Rivers, but both
well known at Montreal, whence they drew members of their party, had
in their wide wanderings traversed the Ottawa, the St. Lawrence,
the Great Lakes, Labrador, the return west of the Mississippi, the
great northwest and the overland route to Hudson's Bay, the west, the
northwest and the west. In 1659 it is stated Radisson and Groseilliers
discovered the upper Mississippi and the lands of the great northwest
ten years before Marquette Joliet, twenty years before La Salle, a
hundred years before La Vérendrye. Radisson's manuscripts being rescued
from oblivion in 1885 are alleged to prove their claims. The course
of the first exploration of Radisson seems to have circled over the
territory now known as Wisconsin, perhaps eastern Iowa and Nebraska,
South Dakotas, Montana and back over North Dakota and Minnesota to the
north shore of Lake Superior. This was the southwest. On his return he
passed by the scene of Dollard's exploit at the Long Sault. At Quebec
they were feted but when afterwards it had leaked out that they had
heard of the famous sea of the north and they had asked to continue
their explorations, the French governor refused except on condition of
receiving half the profits. On this the adventurers with two Indian
guides for the upper country, who chanced to be in Montreal and whom
they had taken to Three Rivers, stole out thence to the north country
and in 1662 discovered Hudson's Bay by the overland route with the aid
of friendly Crees. By the spring of 1663 they were back to the Lake
of the Woods region, accompanied by 700 Indians of the upper country.
Eventually they made their way to Quebec and were received with salvos
of canon. Their fortune of pelts was valued in modern money at $30,000,
of which the governor claimed for the revenue so much that but $20,000
worth was left. They then turned their allegiance elsewhere. The
stories of their various changes of allegiance to and fro, from the
French both in the New and Old France to the English, does not concern
us. This has blackened their name but does not gainsay their claims to
a share in the great discoveries mentioned. At the same time as they
never appear to have made a formal claim or took a formal "prise de
possession" for France, it is not to be wondered that historians will
continue to give the credit to the already accredited discoverers.
The five writers who according to the author we are noticing, have
attempted to redeem Radisson's memory from ignominy are: Dr. N. G.
Dionne, of the Parliament Library of Quebec; Mr. Justice Prud'homme,
of St. Boniface, Manitoba; Dr. George Bryce, of Winnipeg; Mr. Benjamin
Sulte, of Ottawa, and Judge J. Z. Brower, of St. Paul. (Vide the

[Illustration: VIEW OF ISLAND OF STE. HELEN]

In the commencement of the summer of 1687, Denonville, who had made
his preparations secretly and had received reinforcements of 800 men
with 168,000 _livres_ in money or supplies from France, determined to
carry to a finish his long projected war policy against the Iroquois
supported by the English under Dongan, by stealing upon them unawares.
St. Helen's Island opposite Montreal was the scene of a great military
camp. Thither the new intendant, de Champigny-Noroy--the successor
of de Meulles, who had been recalled upon the complaints of the
governor--had gone on June 7th with the Chevalier de Vaudreuil, lately
arrived in the colony with the title of commander of the forces. The
army of four battalions, commanded by the Governor de Denonville in
person, was composed, says Bibaud, of 800 regular soldiers, about a
thousand Canadians and 300 Indians, mostly from the missions of Sault
St. Louis and the Mountain. M. de Callières, the governor of Montreal,
also was there. It started on June 11th on 200 flatboats and as many
birch bark canoes, and struggling against the rapids made its way for
Fort Frontenac. Just after the departure the 800 regulars arrived
from France and were left at Montreal to protect the settler. We have
not usually related the details of these expeditions from Montreal
and its vicinity, but the opening incident on this occasion, known as
Denonville's treachery, resulting in the massacre of Lachine on August
25, 1689, was so fateful in its dire results for Montreal that it must
be told.

[Illustration: PLAN OF MONTREAL, 1687-1723]

Arriving at Fort Frontenac, it was found that there were in the
neighbourhood a number of Iroquois of the two neutral villages of
Kenté (Quinté) and Ganneious or Ganeyout, on the north shore of Lake
Ontario, forming a sort of colony, where the Sulpicians of Montreal
had established their mission. They were on excellent terms with the
garrison of Fort Frontenac and hunted and fished for them. These
Denonville determined to seize, partially because of the fear that they
might communicate with their relatives, the hostile Seneca Iroquois,
but principally because he wished to satisfy the desire of Louis XIV
that the Iroquois prisoners of war should be sent to France to be put
in the galleys, "because," said the royal letters, "the savages being
strong and robust, they will serve usefully on our convict gangs."

Accordingly by various artifices, such as by the invitation to a feast,
the unsuspecting and friendly Indians were enticed to the fort by the
advances of the new intendant, Champigny, and then seized, the men
being sent to Quebec and then deported to the galleys in France.[138]
This was a breach of faith, unjustifiable according to the natural law
of nations; these men could in no way have been called prisoners of
war. The other Indians were deeply incensed at this treason and they
brooded over it long and deeply. A sad incident in the story is that
the Jesuit missionary Lamberville was unwittingly the instrument used
to induce the Onondaga chief to accept the invitation to a parley at
Fort Frontenac. When the news of the capture was made known, he was
summoned before a council of the angry Iroquois. The magnanimity of the
Iroquois saved his life. One of them addressed him thus: "You cannot
but agree that all sorts of reasons, authorize us to treat you as an
enemy, but we cannot agree to that; we know you too well not to be
persuaded that your heart has had no part in the treason against us in
which you have shared, and we are not unjust enough to punish you for
a crime of which we believe you are innocent, and for which without
doubt you are in despair for having been the instrument. But it is not
fitting that you should remain here, for when once our young men have
sung the war cry, they will see in you for the future nothing but a
traitor, who has delivered our chiefs to the most disgraceful slavery.
Then fury will fall on you and we shall not be able any longer to save
you."[139] They gave him guides and sent him back to Denonville.[140]

Meanwhile La Durantaye arrived with news of the capture of the Dutch
and English traders under Rosenboom and Major Patrick McGregor, who had
been carried to Niagara and afterward to Quebec, a proceeding which
mightily angered the English governor of New York, Dongan. The war soon
began; the rendezvous was at Irondequoit Bay on the borders of the
Seneca country. There were gathered the armies of Denonville, joined
by the flotilla of La Durantaye, with Duluth and his cousin Tonti, who
had come from Niagara, the Ottawas from Michillimackinac and savages of
every nation. There were the regulars from France, the Canadian militia
under de Callières of Montreal, the Jesuit chaplains, the Sulpician, de
Belmont, from Montreal, the noblesse, the Christian Indians from the
Montreal district, the hardy explorer Nicholas Perrot and others, such
as Le Moyne de Longueuil. Nearly three thousand men, red and white,
were under Denonville on July 12, when the march against the Senecas
began and most men of note in the colony seemed to be there. On the
24th of July the army returned to the fortified fort at Irondequoit Bay
and shortly descended to Montreal, victorious in name. But the Senecas
were only scotched, not killed.

The expedition returned to Montreal in August. In October the Iroquois,
to the number of 200, attacked the upper part of Montreal, where they
burned five houses and killed six _habitants_. The consequence was
that de Callières (the governor) caused a redoubt to be constructed in
each seignory, so that the troops quartered there and the inhabitants
could find refuge in the hour of attack. A contemporary writer says
that there were twenty-eight such forts in the government of Montreal.
A corps of 120 men picked from the _coureurs de bois_ was placed at
Lachine, but the great massacre there was not to occur till 1689. Thus
Montreal was virtually enclosed in de Callières' palisaded picket. "New
troops were called for from France and the plan of the next campaign
was to advance with two columns in distinct expeditions against the
Iroquois.

"The possession of New York by the French as a desirable acquisition
was advocated by the leading men in Canada more than ever." De
Callières, the governor of Montreal, was conceiving a plan for such an
invasion.[141]

This became more popular as James II, on November 10, 1687, formally
claimed the Iroquois as subjects and ordered Dongan to protect them.
This was the beginning of the long struggle between the two powers,
the supremacy of the west being the bone of contention, for the
trade of which the English were always "itching." As this trade was
Montreal's support we may realize the anxiety present during the
next year, 1688. For two years the trade had been stopped. Montreal
was again in a siege. The Iroquois moved about mysteriously in small
bands, and paralyzed agriculture. The early history of Montreal was
being reproduced; yet the country had far more troops than formerly.
At the head of the Island of Montreal a large body of militia under
Vaudreuil was on guard. In the midst of this anxiety negotiations took
place with the great and crafty diplomatist, Big Mouth, the chief
of the Onondagas, who on the promise of Denonville to return the
prisoners captured up west, made his way to Montreal, in spite of the
prohibitions of Sir Edward Andros, who had now succeeded Dongan, with
six Onondaga, Cayuga and Oneida chiefs; but, it is said, he had sent
ahead a force of 1,200 men. He arrived at Montreal on June 8, 1688. A
declaration of neutrality was drawn up and he promised that within a
certain time the whole confederacy should come to Montreal to conclude
a general peace. They never came. For, although they were on their
way, Kondiaronk, surnamed the Rat, the renowned chief of the Hurons
at Michillimackinac, a most astute man, treacherously "killed" the
peace as he boasted, by intercepting and firing on them, pretending he
had been prompted to this action by Denonville. Thus he aroused the
Iroquois against the French. For his fear was that should peace be
concluded with the Iroquois, the French allies, such as the Hurons,
would not be protected against their hereditary enemies, the Iroquois.
Hence Montreal never saw the delegation. But the danger still hovered
around, although Denonville with false security still wrote to France
that there was hope of peace. The Iroquois, however, had not forgotten
his treachery at Fort Frontenac. Their brethren in the galleys of
France called for vengeance.

The winter of 1688 and part of the summer of 1689 passed quietly
enough. Changes had occurred in the government. Denonville received his
recall by a letter of May 31, 1689, being needed for the war in Europe.
St. Vallier had been consecrated bishop of Quebec on January 25th.
Count Frontenac was named governor for a second time. De Callières, the
governor of Montreal, being replaced in his absence by de Vaudreuil,
was in France communicating his ambitious plans of conquering New York
as the only means of preserving the colony.[142] Incidentally he was
to be New York's new governor. It could be done, he argued, with the
forces in Canada, 1,000 regulars and 600 militia, and two royal ships
of war. The king modified the scheme and adopted it, but it never
came into execution. The long delay in the preparation of the ships
and the unexpectedly long passage of Callières and Frontenac across
the Atlantic, caused by head winds, ruined the enterprise. The two
governors did not reach Quebec until October 12th, bringing back with
them from the galleys of France the remnant of the Iroquois. Thence
they left on October 20th and arrived at Montreal on October 27th,
where Denonville, with Duluth in charge of the garrison, was still
making the last arrangements for maintaining the peace of Montreal
before departing for France. But this was not to be till after the
horrible massacre of reprisal, so long threatened, that fell upon the
island at Lachine on the night of August 5, 1689.

The story of the disaster at Lachine, saddening the last days
of Denonville, must now be told in the graphic words of Parkman
(Frontenac, pp. 177-181).

"On the night before the 4th and 5th of August a violent hailstorm
burst over Lake St. Louis, an expansion of the St. Lawrence, a little
above Montreal. Concealed by the tempest and the darkness, 1,500
warriors landed at Lachine and silently posted themselves about the
houses of the sleeping settlers, then screeched the war whoop and
began the most frightful massacre in Canadian history. The houses were
burned and men, women and children indiscriminately butchered. In the
neighbourhood were three stockade forts, called Rémy, Rolland and La
Présentation; and they all had garrisons. There was also an encampment
of 200 regulars about three miles distant, under an officer named
Subercasse, then absent from Montreal on a visit to Denonville, who
had lately arrived with his wife and family. At four o'clock in the
morning the troops in this encampment heard a cannon shot from one of
the forts. They were at once ordered under arms. Soon after, they saw
a man running toward them just escaped from the butchery. He told
his story and passed on with the news to Montreal, six miles distant.
Then several fugitives appeared, chased by a band of Iroquois who gave
up the pursuit at sight of the soldiers but pillaged several houses
before their eyes. The day was well advanced before Subercasse arrived.
He ordered the troops to march. About a hundred armed inhabitants had
joined them and they moved together toward Lachine. Here they found the
houses still burning and the bodies of the inmates strewn among them
or hanging from the stakes where they had been tortured. They learned
from a French surgeon, escaped from the enemy, that the Iroquois were
all encamped a mile and a half further on, behind a tract of forest.
Subercasse, whose force had been strengthened by troops from the forts,
resolved to attack them; and had he been allowed to do so, he would
probably have punished them severely, for most of them were hopelessly
drunk with brandy taken from the houses of the traders. Sword in hand,
at the head of his men, the daring officer entered the forest; but
at that moment a voice from the rear commanded him to halt. It was
that of the Chevalier de Vaudreuil, just come from Montreal, with
positive orders from Denonville to run no risks and stand solely on the
defensive. Subercasse was furious. High words passed between him and
Vaudreuil, but he was forced to obey.

[Illustration: WAR DANCE]

"The troops were led back to Fort Rolland, where about five hundred
regulars and militia were now collected under command of Vaudreuil. On
the next day eighty men from Fort Rémy attempted to join them, but the
Iroquois had slept off the effects of their orgies and were again on
the alert. The unfortunate detachment was set upon by a host of savages
and cut to pieces in full sight of Fort Rolland. All were killed or
captured except Le Moyne de Longueuil, and a few others who escaped
within the gate of Fort Rémy.

"Montreal was wild with terror. It had been fortified with palisades
since the war began and though there were troops in the town under the
governor himself, the people were in mortal dread. No attack was made
either on the town or on any of the forts, and such of the inhabitants
who could reach them were safe while the Iroquois held undisputed
possession of the open country, burned all the houses and barns over
an extent of nine miles, and roamed in small parties pillaging and
scalping over more than twenty miles. There is no mention of their
having encountered opposition, nor do they seem to have met with any
loss but that of some warriors killed in the attack on the detachment
from Fort Rémy, and that of three drunken stragglers who were caught
and thrown into a cellar in Fort La Présentation. When they came to
their senses they defied their captors and fought with such ferocity
that it was necessary to shoot them. Charlevoix says that the invaders
remained in the neighbourhood of Montreal till the middle of October,
or for more than two months. But this seems incredible, since troops
and militia enough to drive them all into the St. Lawrence might easily
have been collected in less than a week. It is certain, however, that
their stay was strangely long. Troops and inhabitants seemed to have
been paralyzed with fear. At length the most of them took to their
canoes and recrossed Lake St. Louis in a body, giving ninety yells
to show that they had ninety prisoners in their clutches. This was
not all, for the whole number carried off was more than a hundred
and twenty, besides about two hundred who had the good fortune to be
killed on the spot. As the Iroquois passed the forts they shouted:
'Onontio! You deceived us! And now we have deceived you!' Towards
evening they encamped on the farther side of the lake and began to
torture and devour their prisoners. On that miserable night, stupefied
and speechless groups stood gazing from the strand of the Lachine at
the lights that gleamed along the distant shore of Chateauguay, where
their friends, wives, parents or children agonized in the fires of
the Iroquois and scenes were enacted of indescribable and nameless
horror. The greater part of the prisoners were, however, reserved to be
distributed among the towns of the confederacy and there tortured for
the diversion of the inhabitants. While some of the invaders went home
to celebrate their triumph others roamed in small parties through all
the upper parts of the colony, spreading universal terror."[143]


NOTE

THE EXPLOIT AT THE RIVIERE DES PRAIRIES, 1690

Since writing the last chapter important facts almost forgotten
concerning the brilliant exploit against the Iroquois at the Rivière
des Prairies, which almost rivals that of Dollard's companions at
the Long Sault, have been made public by Mr. E. Z. Massicotte in
the "Canadian Antiquarian and Numismatic Journal" No. 3, 1914. The
intendant, Champigny, had officially and briefly reported it and
it had been also commented on sparsely or inaccurately by Ferland,
"Histoire du Canada," Volume II, pp. 209-210, by de Belmont, "Histoire
du Canada," and by Tanguay in his "Dictionnaire" and in a mémoire
attributed to deLery. From these authorities and the study of the
registers of Pointe aux Trembles for 1690 and 1694 Mr. Massicotte
has been enabled to reconstruct the story and identify the heroes.
Four days after the horrible hecatomb of Lachine, i.e., on the 9th of
August, 1689, the Iroquois, emboldened by their success, spread over
the island of Montreal and below it they massacred Pierre Dagenets dit
Lespine and probably burned his wife, Anne Brandon, whose disappearance
is recorded at this time. They also besieged the mill of Rivière des
Prairies recently constructed. But this was only by way of prelude.

In the spring of 1690 the Indians, who had sown terror the preceding
year, now probably on their way to combine with Phipps in the attack
on Quebec, invaded anew the neighbourhood of Montreal and committed
several acts of brigandage. On the 2d of July, warned of the presence
of Iroquois on the Rivière des Prairies, some inhabitants of Pointe aux
Trembles, under the command of Sieur de Colombet, a former lieutenant,
went to meet the enemy. Posted near the river, they fired on the
marauders and killed four of their men in a canoe. The Iroquois,
numbered a hundred, and as the opposing force of _habitants_ formed
only a little group of twenty to twenty-five, Champigny's account "le
combat fut rude" was very descriptive. Sixteen of the French remained
on the field dead or taken prisoners. The rest in all haste partook
themselves for safety to the little fort not far distant. The enemy
lost thirty warriors and made their way to Ile Jésus to burn some
of their captives; the rest they carried away to suffer the like
fate, with the exception of one, whom Father Pierre Millet, himself
a prisoner among the Onneyouts at the time, records as having been
spared. Such was the fear of the lurking Iroquois that the eight bodies
were buried in all haste on the field of glory, but on November 2,
1694, the registry of Pointe aux Trembles tells us the bodies were
exhumed and reburied together in consecrated ground.

The list of the slain is as follows: (1) De Colombet, commandant; (2)
Joseph de Maintenon, Sieur de la Rue; (3) Jean Gallot, surgeon; (4)
Guillaume Richard, dit Lafleur, Captain, "de la Milice" de Pointe aux
Trembles; (5) Joseph Cartier, dit Larose; (6) Jean Baudoin (fils); (7)
Pierre Marsta (fils); (8) Jean Delpne, dit Parisot; (9) Nicholas Joly;
(10) A hired man of one Beauchamp; (11) Isaac, a soldier.

Made prisoners and burnt: (12) Jean Rainaud, dit Planchard; (13) Jean
Grou; (14) Paschange; (15) Le Bohême.

Made prisoners and released: (16) Pierre Payet, dit St. Amour; (17)
Wounded, probably, Antoine Chaudillon, surgeon.


FOOTNOTES:

[138] On October 31 Dongan wrote to Denonville demanding that these
Iroquois should be surrendered to the English ambassador at Paris. On
August 10, 1689, Denonville wrote to France begging the King to send
back the captured Indians to Canada, and on October 15, 1689, thirteen
Iroquois returned with Frontenac--all that remained of those sent to
the galleys.

[140] This scandalous act of treachery on the part of a Christian
nation was bewailed by the Abbé de Belmont, the Montreal Sulpician
and historian who was present on this expedition. "It is pitiable,"
he wrote, "that the Indians under our protection were thus seized,
pillaged and chained, seduced under the bait of a feast." And he adds,
"If in the beginning we were too violent, we were too weak and humble
at the close."

[142] This expedition was meant to be a serious check to the English
pretensions of supremacy over the Iroquois. A memoir of this period
shows the claims of the French as follows: That the Iroquois had
submitted in 1604; that Champlain had taken possession of their lands
in the name of the King; that they had declared themselves to be the
subjects of France in the treaty with M. de Tracy in 1655-6, and that
the subsequent treaty of the Iroquois with the English in 1684 could
not prevail against rights already acquired. Frontenac and de Callières
were to attack Orange and if that expedition succeeded, they were to
attack Manhattan and M. de Vaudreuil was to undertake the government in
their absence.

[143] Bibaud, in his "Histoire du Canada," says that "the Island of
Montreal was not free from the presence of these ferocious enemies
(the Iroquois) until the middle of October when Denonville sent Duluth
and de Mantet, well accompanied, to the Lake of Two Mountains to make
certain whether the retreat of the Iroquois was real or only simulated.
These officers met twenty-two Iroquois in two canoes, who came to
attack them with much determination. They withstood the first gunshots
without firing but after that they boarded them and killed eighteen. Of
the few that remained, one saved himself by swimming, but the others
were taken prisoners and given over to the fire of the Indian allies."

On arriving at Quebec on October 25, 1689, Frontenac, learning that the
colony was seized with a sort of paralysis caused by discouragement and
stupor, set out by the boats for Montreal in spite of the incessant
rains, and he found it a scene of desolation and dejection,[144] after
the disaster of Lachine. Frontenac was now a man of seventy years,
but it was felt that with all his imperious failings, now mellowed by
age, he possessed in a high degree, military knowledge and valour and
was the man to meet the desperate state of affairs. Encouraged by the
consciousness of this, he accordingly left the gay court of Louis XIV,
_le Soleil_, determined to prove his loyal attachment to his prince. On
his arrival he was ostensibly welcomed on all hands. And on his part
he was mindful of his charge dated June 7, 1689, to forget his former
dissensions and to govern with moderation and wisdom and to favour the
clergy, although he was to keep an eye on the Jesuits.

At Montreal he reviewed the troops, seven or eight hundred of whom were
in garrison, the rest being scattered in the forts. Having restored
confidence, he turned his attention quickly toward conciliating or
subduing the Iroquois. His first move was to send a deputation to
Onondaga from "the great Onontio, who as you all know has come back
again." With it he sent three of the released Indians whom he had
brought back from the galleys of France, to invite them to meet the
Onontio at Fort Frontenac and to give back allegiance. These overtures
were spurned.

Later came news to Montreal from Father Carheil, the Jesuit, saying
that the Huron and Ottawa tribes, their allies, around Michillimackinac
were on the point of revolt, going over to the Iroquois and the
English. Nicholas Perrot was sent with a haughty message. "I am strong
enough," says Onontio, "to kill the English, destroy the Iroquois and
whip you if you fail in your duty." A temporary peace was secured by
the adroitness of Nicholas Perrot.

Frontenac now turned his attention to the English and planned his
descent on Albany and the border settlements of New Hampshire and
Maine. Of the three war parties of picked men, organized at Quebec,
Three Rivers and Montreal, the latter, which was to attack Maine, was
first ready, consisting of 210 men, ninety-six of whom were Christian
Iroquois from Sault St. Louis or the Mountain settlement, and the rest
being hardy and venturesome bush rangers skilled in woodcraft and
Indian warfare. Their leaders were men equal to the task, d'Ailleboust
de Mantet and Le Moyne de St. Hélène. Other brave sons of Charles Le
Moyne also supported them, Le Moyne d'Iberville, Le Moyne de Bienville
and others of the _noblesse_, men of nerve, and adventurous.

"It was the depth of winter," says Parkman, "when they began their
march, striding on snowshoes over the vast white field of the frozen
St. Lawrence, each with the hood of his blanket coat drawn over his
head, a gun in his mittened hand, a knife, a hatchet, a tobacco pouch
and a bullet pouch at his belt, a pack over his shoulders and his
inseparable pipe hung at his neck in a leather case. They dragged their
blankets and provisions over the snow on Indian sledges."

They crossed to Chambly. How on February 8, 1690, this party (Montreal
losing but two men) put Corlaer (Schenectady), about fifteen miles from
Albany and the furthest outpost of the colony of New York, to massacre
and ashes, and finally, although victorious, had to retreat to Montreal
across the ice of Lake Champlain, worn out and closely pursued almost
to the very gates of the town by Iroquois and fifty men from Albany,
so that fifteen or more of a party of stragglers were killed or taken
prisoners, it is not necessary to relate in detail, nor is it necessary
to recount the furthest story of the universal war now kindled like
wildfire. The three expeditions were, however, victorious.

Retaliation was being prepared by the Iroquois and the English during
the spring. A combined attack was to be made on Canada. The colonial
militia of New York were to meet at Albany and thence advance on
Montreal by way of Lake Champlain; Massachusetts and the other New
England states were to attack Quebec under Sir William Phipps, the
former coarse ship-carpenter, rough sailor-captain and brusque governor
of Massachusetts, proud of his obscure origin and his career as a
self-made man, blunt in speech and manner, doubtfully honest in private
dealing, but believing that all was fair in war and business, patriotic
and devoted withal to New England.

While these hostile preparations against Quebec and Montreal were being
matured, Frontenac was at Quebec, sparring with the council as to the
degree of dignity with which he was to be received at the meetings
of the Supreme Council when he should visit it for the first time.
Then he turned his attention to _saving_ the country, which was his
_forte_, strengthening the rear of Quebec, fortifying the settlements
and keeping strong scouting parties in Montreal to guard the settlers,
who were being occasionally broken in upon and burned and butchered as
of old, by the war parties of their hereditary enemies, the Iroquois.
Then, late in July, he left for Montreal, the chief point of danger,
and with him went the Intendant Champigny, leaving Town Major Prevost
to finish the fortifications of Quebec.

Montreal was reached on July 31st. A few days of August had passed when
the commandant of Fort Lachine came in hot haste to report that Lake
St. Louis was "full of canoes," as Frontenac wrote to the minister on
November 9th and 12th. Fright gave way to pleasure when it was found
that it was a friendly party of 300 Indians coming with 110 canoes,
laden with beaver skins to the value of nearly a hundred thousand
crowns from the upper lakes, descending from Michillimackinac to trade
at Montreal. A few days later La Durantaye, the recent commander of
Michillimackinac, arrived with fifty-five more canoes loaded with
valuable furs and manned by French traders. The trade was flowing back
from the English market to Montreal.[145] Frontenac was in high feather
at the success of his policy, at least with the lake tribes.

Soon a grand council was prepared to precede the market, according to
custom. Such a crowd there was of painted, greased and befeathered
Hurons, Ottawas, Ojibways, Pottawattomies, Crees and Nipissings,
mingling with the officials and traders around Frontenac. They talked
of trade and war and politics, and they exhorted one another to fight
the English and the Iroquois to the death. Then old Frontenac took a
hatchet and brandishing it sang the war song and led the war dance, in
which all the motley crowd joined, like a screeching mass of frenzied
madmen, possessed by devils it would seem to judge by their wild
contortions. Nor did Onontio lose caste with the Indians; he knew his
people and he gained in estimation with them. Then came the solemn war
feast--two oxen and six large dogs chopped into pieces and basted with
prunes, and two barrels of wine and plenty of tobacco.

During the market days following there was an alarm of Iroquois and
English coming down the Richelieu to attack Montreal. To La Prairie
went Frontenac with 1,200 men to meet the attack. But he did not find
the expected assailants; so leaving a small force he returned to
Montreal and paid the final courtesies to his Indian guests, with whom
he had ingratiated himself.

Hard on their departure, news came from La Prairie that the expected
assailants had arrived and fallen on the soldiers and inhabitants as
they were reaping in the fields, twenty-five being killed or captured,
cattle being destroyed and houses burned. The news was quickly boomed
around by the answering guns of Chambly, La Prairie and Montreal.
Little damage was done, for it was but a small remnant, under Captain
John Schuyler, of the vaunted expedition against Montreal, which had
been reduced by dissension and disease; it soon retired.

On the 10th of October Major Prevost sent a note from Quebec telling of
the advance of Sir William Phipps' navy against Quebec. That evening
Frontenac departed for Quebec by canoe, ordering 200 men to follow
him. On the next day a fresh message from Prevost confirmed the former
saying that the English fleet was already above Tadoussac. Frontenac
sent back Captain de Ramezay to de Callières, the governor of Montreal,
bidding him to descend to Quebec with all the force at his disposal,
and to beat up the inhabitants on the way to join the muster. He
arrived in Quebec on October 14th and on the 16th Phipps entered the
harbour.

We must resist the temptation to describe the defence of Quebec. One
incident in the siege, which must be related, is the arrival, on the
evening of October 16th, of the Montreal contingent, the noise of
the welcome in Upper Town being heard by Phipps as his vessels were
lying idly at their moorings down below. The officers asked a French
prisoner, Granville, the meaning of the noise. "Ma foi! Messieurs,"
said he, "You have lost the game. It is the governor of Montreal
arriving with the people from the country above. There is nothing for
you now but to pack and go home."

The Montreal contingent was a powerful body of 800 men, regulars and
_coureurs de bois_ and gay young volunteers spoiling for the fight.
Nearly all the manhood of Canada was gathered in the precincts of the
fortressed rock of Quebec. Finally, on October 24th, Phipps retired
behind the Island of Orleans to mend his rigging and repair his ships.
His expedition was a failure. To this the Montrealers had largely
contributed. Among their noblesse were the gallant sons of Le Moyne,
who distinguished themselves, although Jacques Le Moyne de Ste.
Hélène died of the wounds received in the siege, a great loss to the
colony, for he was, says Charlevoix, one of its bravest knights and
citizens. When Louis XIV wrote on the 7th of May, 1691, to Frontenac
and Champigny, the intendant, the king gave Le Moyne de Longueuil,
and his brother, de Maricourt, commands of companies and a promise of
good things in store for d'Iberville and a commission to undertake the
enterprise of Fort Nelson and Hudson Bay to drive the English away.
Later de Callières and others were to be remembered by the king for
their good services. Frontenac himself received a gratification of
6,000 _livres_, which no doubt he needed, for he had consumed all his
property.

Next spring, that of 1691, the Iroquois, after the winter hunting,
gathered at the mouth of the Ottawa, and parties went forth to harass
the settlements. Soon Pointe aux Trembles and the Mountain Mission were
attacked. Near Fort Repentigny, young François de Bienville, one of Le
Moyne's sons, was killed in an attack of the marauders.

In midsummer, a detachment of 266 men--120 English and Dutch and the
rest Iroquois allies--under Major Peter Schuyler, advancing upon
Montreal, met the French at La Prairie de la Madeleine, opposite
Montreal. Thither, de Callières had moved. At first the English had the
day, but owing to the intrepid conduct of Valrennes they were forced
to flee. For before reaching their canoes on the Richelieu they were
intercepted by Valrennes, who gave Schuyler's party, according to
Frontenac's statement, "the most hot and stubborn fight ever known in
Canada."

Thus, was Montreal and Canada in a state of great trial in the summer
of 1691 and the year of 1692. Frontenac wrote home, "What with fighting
and hardship, our troops and militia are wasting away. The enemy is
upon us by sea and land. Send us a thousand men next spring, if you
want the country to be saved. We are perishing by inches; the people
are in the depth of poverty; the war has doubled prices, so that nobody
can live; many families are without bread. The inhabitants desert the
country and crowd into the towns."

The fortifications of Montreal and Quebec needed strengthening but
there was little money to further the work. Still something was done.
The country round Montreal during these years of 1691 and 1692 was in
fear and trembling. The farmers worked in the fields with sentinels,
and a guard of regulars protected them, and at night they shivered
in their huts in the rudely fashioned palisaded stockades reared to
protect them. Their anger was so great that fearful reprisals took
place. At Montreal a number of Iroquois captured by Vaudreuil were
burned at the demand of the Canadians and the Mission Indians.

It was a troublous time around Montreal and even the women and children
were called upon to fight. A picture has been preserved to us in the
heroic story of the defence, of Fort Verchères, eight leagues from
Montreal, by Madeleine de Verchères, the fourteen-year-old daughter
of the seigneur of the place, who by her wonderful presence of mind,
coolness and courage saved the lives of a number of women and children,
two soldiers, her young brothers, aged twelve and ten, and an old man
and kept the Iroquois at bay holding the fort for a week in the absence
of her father at Quebec and her mother at Montreal. Then help arrived
after the firing had been heard from Montreal and the Iroquois were
driven off by the relief force from Montreal under M. de la Monnerie at
the head of forty men.[146]

This deed of arms, beginning at eight o'clock in the morning of October
22, 1696, deserves to be commemorated among the noblest actions of
heroic womanhood. There is room for the painter, the romancist, or
the sculptor, justly to celebrate the glory of a national heroine in
Marie-Madeleine de Verchères.

In 1693, in January, a great expedition which was largely followed
by the Mission Indians of Sault St. Louis (Caughnawaga) and the
Mountain, those from Lorette at Quebec, Abenakis from the Chaudière
and Algonquins from Three Rivers, left Chambly on snowshoes for the
Iroquois towns--a party of 625 men under Mantet, Courtemanche and Noue.
On February 16th they took three of these towns.

This year, there was again great rejoicing in Montreal. Frontenac
had planned to escort the Indians with their furs to Montreal from
Michillimackinac, and he came to Montreal to witness their arrival with
canoes plentifully filled with beaver skins, the escort being under
Commandant de Louvigny. Frontenac was the hero of the hour. "It is
impossible," says the Chronicle, "to conceive the joys of the people
when they beheld these riches. Canada had awaited them for years. The
merchants and the farmers were dying of hunger. Credit was gone and
everybody was afraid that the enemy would waylay and seize this last
resource of the country. Therefore, it was that none could find words
strong enough to praise and bless him, by whose care all the wealth had
arrived. _Father of the people, Preserver of the Country_, seemed terms
too weak to express their gratitude."[147]

We are not writing the history of Canada or of Frontenac, consequently
we must pass over much contemporary history of this period. But we
may be rightfully concerned with the history of notable Montrealers
then consolidating New France. During the latter administration of
Frontenac, Montreal's sons reached the height of their careers. These
latter were here, there, and everywhere, engaging in the struggle for
mastery in the West or for that of Hudson's Bay, or of Newfoundland or
lastly of Acadia--these four regions all coming under the government
of Frontenac and each of them being largely influenced by the Canadian
noblesse whose center was at Montreal.

In the West, on the banks of the Mississippi, among the Illinois,
there were to be found men who had at one time or other made Montreal
their headquarters, and who had taken their share in the discovery
of the Great River and had founded posts and cities and colonies and
had become the governors of provinces such as that of Louisiana,
which from 1678 to 1754 was ruled by d'Iberville, de Bienville, La
Motte-Cardillac, and de Vaudreuil. Men like La Salle, the sons of
Charles Le Moyne, the Montreal interpreter, viz., d'Iberville, de
Bienville, de Sérigny, de Chateauguay; de Tonti, du Luth, de la Forêt
and others--a pleiad of illustrious Montreal names--men of courage
and audacity--are not only captains of whom any city may be proud but
they belong to the history of the Continent of North America. Their
discoveries, their adventures, their exploits, oftentimes heroic, are
recorded in the pages of history, dealing with regions stretching from
Hudson's Bay and Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico.

It is often forgotten that Montreal is the Mother of the West. These
men, living in a time of faith, hope, and romantic chivalry, held their
lives in daily peril, exposed themselves to unheard of privations led
on by the desire, for glory or for gain, of conquering the unknown and
acquiring territories for their beloved France and for the expansion
of Christendom.[148] Thus they rose above the ranks of mere soldiers
of fortune, vulgar adventurers, or careless _coureurs de bois_. We
are fascinated by the story of their wanderings accompanied by their
Jesuit, Récollet or Sulpician chaplains,[149] to primeval forests and
plains, over lofty mountain peaks and through deep dales, nowploring
mines of copper or land on the Mississippi or restlessly crossing
the mighty rivers and lakes in their birch bark canoes or their flat
bottomed bateaux; now as hunters or fishermen, sometimes in want and
disease, but always gay; now trading in skins or acting as captains
of vessels of war, or as commanders defending their far off posts,
or attacking the Iroquois or the rival English. An atmosphere of the
marvelous and heroic surrounds these makers of Canada and creates
in one the desire to relate their histories and their wanderings by
land and water, in detail. Out of all these one family stands out
preëminently--that of Charles Le Moyne, settled in Montreal since 1646.
He was the father of eleven sons, of whom the third, Pierre Le Moyne,
d'Iberville (born in Montreal in 1662), was the most famous. Others
were de Longueuil, de Sérigny, de Maricourt, d'Assigny, Ste. Hélène,
the two Chateauguays, the two Bienvilles and Antoine Le Moyne, who died
young--types of the hardy Canadian _noblesse_.

[Illustration: LE MOYNE D'IBERVILLE]

Seven of these sons lived long enough to die heroically on the field
of battle or to become distinguished administrators of the colonies.
These were native born and of obscure parentage, yet they aspired to
positions which were in those days rarely given but to those of noble
birth coming from France. From all these notable sons, d'Iberville
stands out giantlike; his actions being almost legendary in their
records of heroism.

We now treat of his invasion of Newfoundland made conjointly with de
Sérigny, his brother, after he had seized a frigate of twenty-four
cannons at the entrance of the River St. Jean and captured Pemaquid
on August 15, 1696, whither he had sailed in command of the Envieux;
thence he sailed again to Placentia in Newfoundland. There he set
out to take St. John, the chief port of the English, which he burned
to the ground. During the winter he led a hardy party through hamlet
after hamlet--each man provided with a musket, a battle axe, a dagger
knife and snowshoes, and when the spring of 1697 opened all the
English posts were destroyed according to orders received from the
minister dated March 31, 1696, except those of Bona Vista and the
Island of Carbonnière. Thus the safety from invasion of Canada by
the English was hoped to be rendered secure. When d'Iberville had
returned to Placentia, of which he had been appointed governor in
advance, as well as of all the posts seized by him, and was preparing
to attack the two remaining British strongholds, his brother de Sérigny
arrived, commissioner by the king in the March previously to thrust
the English from Hudson's Bay. With him came five ships of war, the
Pelican, the Palmier, the Profond, the Violent and the Wasp; the
latter with the Dragon, not arrived apparently, was for d'Iberville.
Sérigny's instructions were to take the advice of his brother, who
was undertaking the expense of the expedition. He was to destroy all
the English forts in the bay and to leave no vestiges of them; the
prisoners were to be sent to France or even England. It was to be a war
of extermination of English influence and a strife for the possession
by New France of the fur trade. Fort Bourbon (Fort York of today),
or Fort Nelson, as the English called it, was the chief object of
attack. Already the two brothers had captured it, three years before,
but it had been retaken by the English, to whom it was valuable as it
commanded the fur trade of the interior. How d'Iberville, sailing on
the Pelican, and Sérigny on the Palmier after storms arrived at the
bay and steered mid the threatening ice of the bay into the open sea
to Fort Nelson, 300 miles of those bleak inland waters, and how he
triumphed over ice and storms and the English, this also takes us too
far from Montreal to describe with justice.

Suffice it to say, this glorious campaign assured France for many
years of the possession of the countries of the north and the intrepid
sailor commandant left in a few days for Europe, leaving his brother
de Sérigny in command of the bay. On November 7th he reached the
shores of France and having obtained from the government permission to
reconnoitre the mouths of the Mississippi, he left in 1698 and never
saw Canada again.

Léon Guérin in his "Histoire Maritime de France," draws this picture
of d'Iberville: "He was a hero in the full significance of the
expression." He adds, "If his campaigns, prodigious in their results,
obtained by the most feeble materials, had had Europe for their
witness, instead of the echoless seas bounding the neighbourhood of the
pole, he would have had, in life and after death, a name as celebrated
as those of Jean Bart, Duguay, Trouin and des Tourvilles."

We must now turn to the conquest of the West which was being planned
by Frontenac and the success of which meant continued prosperity
for Montreal as the centre of the paltry trade rather than Albany.
La Motte-Cardillac at Michillimackinac, Tonti and La Forêt at the
fortified rock of St. Louis on the Illinois, Nicholas Perrot, the
_voyageur_, among the Mississippi tribes--all were trying to keep
their allies at peace with one another and the French. Frontenac was
determined to strike a blow up west against the resolute Iroquois who
were the scourge of Canada, supplied with arms from Albany. Things
had been going so badly that a memoir to Champigny and Frontenac on
May 26th tells how the king for the present had decided to abandon
Michillimackinac and all the posts of the West, to withdraw all the
congés to the _coureurs de bois_ and to return to the ancient custom of
relying on the savages themselves to bring their peltries to Montreal.

On April 21, 1697, the king wrote to Frontenac from Marly, arranging
for him to attack Boston and perhaps Manhattan; but on April 27th,
while still outlining the same offensive measures against the English,
he allowed the posts of Michillimackinac, St. Louis and Frontenac to
be continued but forbade the soldiers to trade there. Meanwhile he
had been considering Frontenac's plan of attacking the Iroquois, and
it had his entire approval, expressed in his letter written next day.
These conflicting instructions probably arrived by the same ship.
Champigny and others had been writing to the king and directing his
various policies. Fort Frontenac--his darling first love--it was the
cherished hope of the governor to re-establish and repair. Others
opposed him and wrote to the minister, who informed Frontenac that
Fort Frontenac "must absolutely be abandoned." The letter arrived the
day after the governor had sent 700 men to Lake Ontario to repair it.
The Intendant Champigny wanted their early recall, but the inflexible
Frontenac refused and the fort was repaired, garrisoned and victualed
for a year. It would have been a blunder to give up these forest posts.
They were necessary for the trade and the growth of the country. The
early isolation of the colony could never be repeated. On July 4,
1697, 200 men set out with Frontenac from Montreal and on July 19th
he reached Frontenac. With him was de Callières, suffering from the
gout and mounted on a horse, commanding the first line, and Vaudreuil
the second, as they marched to Onondaga, with the aged governor
carried in an armchair when they reached it; they found it burned by
the inhabitants, who had saved themselves by flight. The campaign was
not successful. Frontenac had not delivered his blow; but it was the
forerunner of the peace of 1701 with the Iroquois, for they feared the
old indefatigable man.

Early in May, 1698, a party of Dutch with "Sieur Abraham," an Iroquois,
arrived in Montreal with the news that peace had been declared in
Europe and at the end of May, Major Peter Schuyler arrived accompanied
by Delius, the minister of Albany, with a copy of the treaty of
Ryswick[150] in French and Latin and bringing back French prisoners in
exchange for English, who nearly all preferred to remain. But the
Iroquois free nations still remained unpacified and Frontenac was again
prepared to direct his force against them to press the French claims to
sovereignty over them as opposed to those of the British.

On November 22d the aged governor, now in his seventy-eighth year and
seized with a mortal illness, was strong enough to make his last will
and testament. On the 28th he died, having become reconciled to the
Intendant Champigny, who wrote that the governor had died with the
sentiments of a true Christian. He was buried by his desire on the
Friday after his death in the church of the Recollects at Quebec, whom
he had favoured so considerably. His great faults were overtowered
by his many eminent qualities. He was the greatest captain in the
seventeenth century in Canada. The Jesuit historian, Charlevoix, says:
"New France owed to him all that it was at his death," "He found the
colony enfeebled," says another cleric historian, Abbé Gauthier,
"attacked on all sides, despised by its enemies; he left it in peace,
increased and respected; again he has been called the Saviour of New
France." He had succeeded in suppressing the Iroquois and had warred
successfully against the English. He had encouraged and upheld the
expedition of that brave son of Montreal, d'Iberville, in Acadia,
Newfoundland and at Hudson's Bay and the enterprises of that intrepid
explorer, La Salle, in the West; surely, he merits a tribute in the
history of Montreal!


NOTE

We are indebted for the story of Madeleine de Verchères to a document
found in the "Collection Moreau Saent-Mery," Vol. 6, entitled,
"Relation des faits Héroïques de Mademoiselle Marie Madeleine de
Verchères (âgée de 14 ans) contre les Iroquois en l'année 1692, le 22
Octobre à huit heures du matin." This description was made by Madeleine
Verchères herself on the request of the intendant (named April 1,
1702), M. le Marquis de Beauharnois, arriving from France to take
possession of his office. The event it seems had caused a stir at court
and therefore a more detailed account was desired. In a previous letter
written on October 15, 1699, a modest account of the story had been
told accompanying a petition to Madame la Comtesse de Maurepas, wife
of the secretary of the marine department, requesting a pension of 50
crowns, as was commonly given to the widows of officers, in view of her
father's poverty--"he has been fifty-five years in the King's service."
In default she asked the promotion of one of her brothers, a cadet in
the army, to be an ensign. "He knows service, he has been engaged in
several expeditions against the Iroquois. I have even had one of my
brothers burned by them." Thus even the very young fought. This young
cadet was then only about nineteen years of age. At this period many
of the sons of the noblesse were sent to France to enter the army or
navy as cadets. There are to be found complaints from the ministers of
these departments that youths as young as thirteen and fifteen years
are being sent. These youths were early accustomed to bear arms; hence
the haste to get into the regular service and to obtain commissions.
D'Iberville was only fourteen years of age when he entered the French
navy, and only twenty-five when he was sent by Denonville to Hudson's
Bay.

The following version of the story of Madeleine de Verchères, based on
her own description above, may be fitly recorded here. Not far from
Montreal and the St. Lawrence stands the Village of Verchères, near
which was the scene of Madeleine Jarret's heroism. In early years that
countryside had been erected into a seigneury and at the time of the
exploit, Madeleine Jarret's father was the Seigneur of Verchères. The
defence of Verchères took place during the last week of October, 1692.
At the time Seigneur Jarret was in Quebec on official business and
his wife was in Montreal. The head of the household was the daughter
Madeleine, a girl of fourteen years, the other members of the family
in the fort being two brothers of Madeleine, who were mere lads, both
younger than herself. On the morning of October 22d, the inhabitants of
the seigneury went as usual to their work in the adjacent fields--and
most of them never to return--leaving in the fort Madeleine, her two
brothers, an old man of eighty and a number of women and children. Such
were the conditions at the Seigneury of Verchères when the Iroquois
suddenly burst upon the place.

[Illustration: MLLE. DE VERCHERES]

During the forenoon, Madeleine went down to the little wharf, or
landing place, not far from the fort, accompanied by a hired man named
La Violette. Suddenly the sounds of firing came from the direction of
the field where the settlers were at work, and the next instant the
servant, La Violette, cried out, "Run, run, here come the Iroquois!"
Turning, she saw forty or fifty Iroquois at a distance of a pistol
shot. She and the man made a dash for the fort, and seeing that they
could not overtake her, the Iroquois fired at the fleeting girl and
man, but missed both. Reaching the fort, she caused the gates to be
closed and fastened, and then set about making the place as secure as
possible. A few palisades had fallen, through which an Indian could
enter the enclosure. She helped to carry palisades, or pickets, to the
places where they were required, and assisted in setting them up.

Then Madeleine went to the blockhouse where the ammunition was kept and
here she said, "I found two soldiers, one hiding in a corner and the
other with a lighted fuse in his hand. 'What are you going to do with
that?' I asked. He answered: 'Light the powder and blow us all up.'
'You are a miserable coward,' said I, 'go out of this place.' I spoke
so resolutely that he obeyed. I then threw off my bonnet and, after
putting on a hat and taking a gun, I said to my brothers: 'Let us fight
to the death. We are fighting for our country. Remember that our father
has taught you that gentlemen are born to shed their blood for the
service of God and the King."

To understand fully the courage of this girl of fourteen, it must
be remembered that these words were addressed to mere lads, twelve
and ten years of age respectively. The brothers were worthy of their
heroic sister. They responded to the call, which also inspired the
two soldiers with some courage, for they took up their guns and began
firing from the loopholes upon the Iroquois, who, ignorant of the
weakness of the garrison, and always reluctant to attack a fortified
place, occupied themselves with chasing and butchering the people in
the neighbouring fields.

Shortly after the appearance of the Iroquois, a settler with his family
in a canoe, was seen approaching the landing. The soldiers would not
venture from the fort, so Madeleine went to the landing alone, and with
a musket in hand, escorted the family to the fort. The very boldness
of the affair caused the Iroquois to think it was a ruse to draw them
near the fort, so that the garrison could rush out upon them, and they
did not dare to attack Madeleine and those she was conducting to the
fort. The arrival of the settler added one to the fighting strength of
the garrison, and Madeleine now gave orders that the Iroquois should be
fired upon whenever seen within range. When night came on a gale began
to blow, accompanied by snow and hail; and the Iroquois hoped to be
able to climb into the fort under cover of darkness. Madeleine now made
the distribution of her small force, upon whose vigilance the lives
of all depended. The two soldiers she stationed in the blockhouse,
and as it was the strongest part of the post, she led there the women
and children. "If I am taken," she said to the two soldiers, "do not
surrender, even if I am cut to pieces and burned before your eyes. The
enemy cannot hurt you in the blockhouse, if you make the least show of
fight."

The outer and chief defence of the fort was a wooden wall, or palisade,
at each corner of which stood a small tower, or bastion. In two of
these towers Madeleine placed her two young brothers, in the third
tower she placed the old man of eighty, while she took the fourth tower
herself. All night long, through the howling wind and driving snow, the
cries of "All's Well" were kept up from the fort to the blockhouse.
"One would have thought," related Madeleine to Governor Beauharnois,
"that the place was full of soldiers. The Iroquois thought so, and were
completely deceived, as they confessed afterwards." They had held a
council to make a plan for capturing the fort in the night, but had
done nothing because such a constant watch was kept.

"At last, the daylight came again; and, as the darkness disappeared,
our anxiety seemed to disappear with it. Everybody took courage, except
the wife of Sieur Fontaine, who, being extremely timid, asked her
husband to carry her to another fort. He said: 'I will never abandon
this fort while Mademoiselle Madeleine is here.' I answered him that
I would never abandon it; that I would rather die than give it up to
the enemy; and that it was of the greatest importance that they (the
Iroquois) should never get possession of any French fort, because if
they got one, they would think that they could get others and would
grow more bold and presumptuous than ever. I may say with truth that I
did not eat or sleep for twice twenty-four hours, but kept always on
the bastion, or went to the blockhouse to see how the people there were
behaving. I always kept a cheerful and smiling face and encouraged my
little company with hope of speedy succour."

Seven days passed, and although the weather continued to be raw and
cold, the Iroquois kept the field, still hoping to be able to capture
the fort and scalp its garrison. "We were a week in constant alarm,
with the enemy always about us," relates Madeleine in her narrative to
Governor Beauharnois. "At last M. de la Monnerie, a lieutenant, sent
by M. de Callières (then commanding at Montreal), arrived in the night
with forty men. As he did not know whether the fort was taken or not,
he approached as silently as possible. One of our sentinels, hearing a
strange sound, cried out, 'Qui Vive?' I was at the time dozing, with
my head on a table and my gun lying across my arms. The sentinel told
me he heard a voice from the river. I went up at once to the bastion
to see whether it was Indians or Frenchmen. I asked, 'Who are you?'
One of them answered, 'We are Frenchmen, it is La Monnerie, who comes
to bring you help.' I caused the gate to be opened, placed a sentinel
there and went down to the river to meet them. As soon as I saw M. de
la Monnerie, I saluted him and said, 'Monsieur, I surrender my arms to
you.' He answered gallantly, 'Mademoiselle, they are in good hands.'
'Better than you think,' I returned. He inspected the fort and found
everything in order and a sentinel on each bastion. 'It is time to
relieve them, Monsieur,' I said, 'We have not been off our bastions for
a week.'"

So ended the siege of Verchères, for learning that the garrison had
received reinforcements, the Iroquois abandoned the undertaking, and
sneaked away to try their fortunes at other little posts, where there
might be a garrison numerically stronger.

The last chapter has treated of Montreal as the base of many military
operations under Frontenac and Callières and has followed the history
of some of its celebrated citizens. We must now survey the town at
closer range. As said, the inhabitants were virtually confined to the
picket enclosure, constructed by de Callières in 1687, yet the king
did not approve of enclosing Montreal with fortifications, thinking
that this expense would be better employed by strengthening the forts
in the West. (Vide mémoire du Roi à M. de Denonville et à Champigny,
Mars 5, 1688.) It is not till May 8, 1694, that the minister wrote to
de Callières saying he might repair the palisades.[151] In the garrison
petty jealousies and struggles for precedence were being maintained.
By an ordinance of Intendant Champigny of June 10, 1688, confirming
a previous one, it was decided that the officers of justice should
hold _préséance_ over the church wardens, both without and within the
church, such as the first places in receiving the _pain bénit_ and
the offertories on Sundays, the receiving of tapers on Candle-Mass
day and palms on Palm Sunday. The time was one of unsettlement and
of terrorized conditions, yet the religious communities were growing
stronger. In 1683 the home of the congregation founded by Marguerite
Bourgeoys had been burned down. Writing to the minister, Denonville
says: "They have lost everything. It would be necessary for them to
build, but they have not a penny to begin with." Yet they started
again, for, says Sister Juchereau in her "Histoire de Quebec:" "They
were so full of confidence in God, they began to build with only
forty _sous_ in their possession." Sister Morin, the historian of
the Hôtel-Dieu says: "After their second house, a stone one, had
been destroyed by fire, the Congregation nuns built a convent on the
site they still occupy; their house touches our enclosure, making us
neighbours; the house is large and spacious, and one of the best built
in town."

Monseigneur de St. Vallier, having seen the nuns some time after the
fire, remarks: "How they subsisted, since the accident befell them
three or four years ago, is truly a marvel. Their entire house was
burned in one night; they saved neither their furniture nor their
wardrobes, happy enough in this that they were themselves rescued; even
then two of their number perished in the flames. The courage of the
survivors bore them up in their extreme poverty." Again he wrote to
the minister of marine in this same year of a group of grown-up girls
to the number of twenty, called the Daughters of Providence, who were
trained and prepared for work by Sister Bourgeoys. He recommended that
a gratuity should be given them to undertake some manufacture.

In 1688 their mission of free and popular education was extended by
Marguerite Bourgeoys' trained workers to Quebec, at the invitation of
St. Vallier, who had bought a house with a yard and garden on November
13, 1686, as the initial step of a foundation and in 1688 the free
schools were opened for the smaller girls.

Those concerned with the history of the birth of philanthropic agencies
in city life will find of interest a decree of the Supreme Council
of Thursday, April 18, 1688, ordering a "Bureau des Pauvres," a Poor
Law Board, to be established in the towns of Quebec, Montreal and
Three Rivers, and other parishes dependent on them, and also in the
country parishes. The object was to discriminate between the honest
poor and the lazy shirkers and the ne'er-do-wells of the period. The
lengthy decree gives elaborate instructions for this purpose and
would delight modern charity organizers. It insists that work should
be carried on by the poor applying for relief. The directors should
be the curé; an executive director of the poor, to do the research
work by investigating into the real state and cause of the poverty
and to find work and to supervise the hiring of the poor and fixing
the remuneration; a third was to be the treasurer, who should keep
account of all the revenues coming from church collections, or public
canvasses for money or gifts in kind; a fourth should be the secretary,
who should keep the records and lists of those applying to the bureau
for assistance. These directors were to be on an equal footing, the
secretary to count their votes and the decisions to be signed by all
the directors present, two to form a _quorum_.

There does not seem to be any grant from the government for the support
of this voluntary charity organization society established by order
of the council, Christian charity and alms giving being, seemingly,
considered to suffice in providing its funds. The directors could,
according to circumstances, chastise the poor by imprisonment in the
dungeon on a bread and water diet, or by retrenchment on their victuals
for a time, according to the enlightenment of the said directors, to
whom the council, under the good pleasure of His Majesty, gives the
power for the case required. Prohibitions were also issued to all
the poor and necessitous against begging under any pretext whatever,
on pain of such punishment as should be adjudged by the council.
The directors were to put themselves in touch with the procurator
general or his substitutes in each jurisdiction. Thus the volunteer
and official sides of civic philanthropy were brought together--an
admirable combination to be more widely imitated these days.

In order to start the new bureau, the council chose directors from out
of its own members, appointing as the first _directeur des pauvres_ the
procurator general of the king, François Madaleine Ruette d'Auteuil;
for the post of treasurer Paul Dupuy, his substitute on the _prévôté_;
and for secretary the clerk of the Supreme Council, Jean Baptiste
Peuvret de Mesnu.

Though admirably mapped out the organization of the Bureaux des Pauvres
in Quebec, Three Rivers and Montreal, ordered by the Sovereign Council
in 1688, appears to have grown weak shortly. Ten years later, in
1698, as the zeal of the citizens needed new inspiration, the order
was renewed and the Rev. Father Leblanc, a Jesuit, was charged by the
bishop of the diocese of Quebec, Mgr. de St. Valier, to preach in the
towns the reorganization of the bureaux. He came for this object to
Montreal on June 1, 1698. In consequence of his sermon two days later
a meeting of the most notable citizens met in one of the halls of the
seminary to form a bureau composed of priests and lay people. Its
business was to place poor children as apprentices to learn a trade,
to put the sick poor into hospitals or to place them with relations in
easier circumstances, to distribute wheat, bread, boots and merchandise
to the poor. The voluntary contributions necessitated a house-to-house
canvass, which was started in June by Madame de Maricour, the
Mademoiselles de Repentigny, and followed in December by Madame
Jucherau de St. Denis and Madame d'Argenteuil. The ladies kept to the
town and immediate suburbs while the men collected in the outlying
districts.

In 1689 St. Vallier called Sister Bourgeoys to Quebec to execute a
project, by him, of the establishment of a home where the poor could
be usefully employed in work. It was early spring; the shifting ice on
the river would not allow a vehicle on the St. Lawrence; there were
no roads to Quebec for carriages, and the aged woman, now sixty-nine
years of age, traveled the whole distance of 180 miles, thither, on
foot through the slushy snow of the woods and across melting ice-bound
streams. Arriving at Quebec, she found that the bishop had changed his
mind and he asked her to undertake a "General Hospital," instead of the
more humble House of Providence originally contemplated. This hospital
her companions directed till it was transferred to the Hospitalières de
St. Joseph in 1692.

In 1693 the "Congregation" started to build a church in their own
grounds with the help of Jeanne LeBer, who offered to share the
expenses, and of her brother, Pierre LeBer, who promised to furnish
all the stone required. It was finished in February, 1695. "During the
night of the 24th of February," says one of the latest historians of
the congregation,[152] "a lurid flame leaped up in the steeple of the
Hôtel-Dieu church. Fiercely it blazed, until the pealing of alarm bells
roused the townspeople and brought them, half dressed, into the ruddily
illuminated streets. As the tumult of a terrified crowd filled the air,
and the red signal of destruction spread over the sky, a panic seized
on many hearts. Each man looked on the white face of his neighbour,
ghastly in the fire's glare, and there read the same question, 'Will
the town be saved?' Then it was that Dollier de Casson, followed by
the priests from the Seminary, came to the place of danger, bearing
the Blessed Sacrament. A passionate prayer went up, 'Lord, save us,
have mercy on us.' The wind veered suddenly, and carried the roaring
flame away from the town. At that manifestation of Divine clemency, a
mighty shout of thanksgiving rent the air. But the maddened element
had to find some fuel. A moment later, the hospital itself was a mass
of flames and smoke. Père Denys, a Récollet, went fearlessly into the
burning church, took out the Blessed Sacrament and carried it, at
first, to the house of a certain merchant named Arnaud." At dawn of
day it found its home in the new church. Later in the day the homeless
Hôtel-Dieu Sisters were brought to the house of the congregation by
Dollier de Casson, and there they lived and worshipped side by side
with the Daughters of Marguerite Bourgeoys, thus carrying on the
friendship begun between Jeanne Mance and Marguerite, the two founders.
A solemn spiritual alliance was drawn up by the two communities, "to
love one another," and years have not severed this friendship.

This new church, the original Notre Dame de Pitié, witnessed, on
August 5th of 1695, a curious and reverent ceremony--the enclosing
of a recluse in a little room behind the altar. This was none other
than Jeanne LeBer, the daughter of the rich trader, Jacques LeBer, of
Montreal, who was a brother of Jean LeBer du Chesne, wounded mortally
at Prairie la Madeleine. She was now in her thirty-third year, being
born on January 4, 1662. After her school days at Quebec were ended in
1677, she led an austere life--practically that of an enclosed nun, in
her own home--scarcely seeing anyone, not even her parents--and this
with her parents' permission. This craving for solitude is hard to
understand for moderns, and we tell the story to give an indication of
the intense religious faith of those days. _Autre temps, autres moeurs._

In 1693 Jeanne LeBer promised to build the church, as said, if she
were to be received as a sister of the congregation and allowed a cell
behind the altar. "She wished the church to be as near as possible a
reproduction of the holy house of Nazareth, oblong in shape, with the
altar placed in the most conspicuous part, between the doors opening
right and left. Her apartment, behind the altar, was to be about ten or
twelve feet in depth, consisting of three stories. The first was to be
a vestry; the second and third reserved for her use."

[Illustration: MADAME LEBER]

"On the evening of August 5th, solemn vespers were chanted in the
parish church, after which a procession was formed, headed by the
clergy. It wended its way to M. LeBer's house, where Jeanne was
absorbed in prayer. She wore a woolen gown of light grey, confined to
the waist by a black belt. Quitting forever the home of her childhood,
breaking asunder the last and closest ties that bound her to earth,
she followed the clergy accompanied by her father and several other
relatives. It was a striking scene. Along the crowded street they
passed: the recluse, clad in penitential garb, with downcast eyes,
quiet bearing and firm step; and the white-haired man, bowed down by
age and sorrow, who seemed, like Abraham and Jeptha, to be leading
the victim to sacrifice. Scarce had the procession reached the church
before Jacques LeBer, no longer master of his anguish, turned back and
went to hide his grief in the now deserted home.[153]

"Dollier de Casson blessed the cell, and as she knelt before him,
exhorted Jeanne LeBer to persevere therein like Magdalen in the Grotto.
He then led her to the threshold and she calmly passed into her new
abode, closing and fastening the door while the choir chanted the
litany of the Blessed Virgin. The following morning, Feast of the
Transfiguration, Dollier de Casson celebrated mass for the first time
in the Congregation Church. Among the faithful knelt M. LeBer, strong
in his heroic resignation."[154] She lived in that cell for nineteen
years, until her death in October, 1714.

Between 1692 and 1694 another block of buildings, consisting of a
residence and flanked by a public church and a private chapel, was
being erected by the Jesuits, now returning. Its site is today covered
by a portion of the city hall and the Court of Justice of Notre Dame
Street, facing Jacques Cartier Square. These buildings of the Jesuits
were destroyed by fire in 1803.[155]

We have to take notice of a new community that is now arising. It
is that of the Recollects, so long absent from the neighbourhood of
Montreal. The letters patent of the king confirming their permission
to continue their establishments at Quebec, Montreal, Plaisance
(Newfoundland) and the Isle of St. Peter, and to extend them to other
places with the consent of the governor, were issued from Versailles
in March, 1692. By 1694 they had their church built, and this, with
their monastery and farm, occupied the large space now covered by Notre
Dame Street from St. Peter to McGill streets and extending south. The
street called Recollect today marks their home, and between this and
the corner of McGill and Notre Dame streets was the western gate of the
city, known as that of the "Recollects."

[Illustration: CHURCH OF THE RECOLLETS]

A ridiculous event occurred in this church in 1694, which is recorded
as the "_prie dieu_ incident," and which caused a certain amount of
taking of sides and dissension and scandal at Montreal and Quebec,
and was the subject of dispatches to France; it illustrates how very
human men were at this time. M. De Callières, the governor of Montreal,
was present with all the _élite_ of Montreal, at the ceremony of
the initiation of two Recollect novices into the order and he was
kneeling at a _prie dieu_, or kneeling desk, in the middle of the
church, "near the altar," in the place of honour. Mgr. de St. Vallier,
who was present, notified him--"in a low voice," says the Intendant
Champigny, who was present--that such a position was reserved for the
governor general and too honourable for a local governor and requested
him to relinguish it, otherwise he would leave the church and take no
further part in the ceremony. "It is my right," said the obstinate de
Callières, who retook the _prie dieu_, and the prelate withdrew so as
not to create a public scandal. Before the entrance of de Callières
the bishop had already noticed the position of the _prie dieu_ and
ordered the Récollets to remove it, but, although they obeyed, two of
de Callières' officers and a soldier replaced it, and it was allowed to
remain. Next day the bishop wrote to the superior to have the obnoxious
_prie dieu_ removed, as with his own, until the governor general came.
The superior "reluctantly" obeyed, but de Callières had his taken
back. On the refusal of the superior to have it again removed, the
bishop interdicted the church on May 13, 1694, forbidding the use of
the church for any ceremonies or the administration of the Sacraments,
"until His Majesty's intentions were learned." This was followed on
July 6th, by a further monition and was later followed by two others
full of more serious charges against de Callières and the superior of
the Recollects.[156]

The orders were obeyed for two months by the Recollects and then,
influenced by the government party, with whom they were popular, and
refusing to obey any longer, they opened their church again with
public ceremonies more solemn than before, urging that the form of
interdict was null. The disagreement went before the Sovereign Council
at Quebec, whiceclared that the bishop had gone beyond his powers,
and that with regard to the further charges against de Callières, he
had acted without collecting sufficient information. It decided to
refer the decision to His Majesty. On the 13th of June, 1695, the
case was called to the notice of the privy council to be settled. At
the same meeting the several other subsequent interdicts, for use of
the Sacraments, issued by the bishop were discussed, as well as the
Tartuffe interdict, which was against Mareuil, a half-pay officer, who
La Motte-Cardillac--himself no lover of the clergy--owns was not an
exemplary character, indeed he had been two years before accused of
using language capable of making heaven blush. This man was reported to
be cast to play the part of Tartuffe in Molière's play, in Frontenac's
private theatricals at Quebec--it being thought that this was meant to
be a scurrilous skit on the clergy and in revenge on the bishop for
the Montreal affair. Mareuil and his friends insulted the bishop and
Mareuil was ordered to prison. The council, however, decided that the
bishop had not gone beyond his legitimate sphere in his mandate against
the "Tartuffe" performance. Many clerics and laymen asked for Mgr. de
St. Vallier's recall. Even Laval in his retirement expressed himself
strongly on his successor, who had gone to France to defend himself
against his enemies, and did not return for three years. After that he
lived in peace with de Callières and de Frontenac.

The above calm description of the scene is that following the Intendant
Champigny's account to the minister on October 27, 1694, and "le
mémoire pour M. l'Evêque de Québec concernant l'interdit prononcé
contre les Récollets de Ville Marie, 1694." La Motte-Cardillac's
bantering account, which is splenetic and bitter, must be read with
caution, as he never shows any mercy to the clerics, whom he whips with
fine scorn for what we should call their "Puritanism." Witness has oft
quoted attack on their condemnation of plays.

Parkman, commenting on these troubles of the austere and overzealous
bishop, says: "An adjustment was effected: order, if not harmony, was
restored; and the usual distribution of advice, exhortation, reproof
and menace was made to the parties in the strife. Frontenac was
commended for defending the royal prerogative, censured for violence
and admonished to avoid future quarrels.... Callières was mildly
advised not to take part in the disputes of the bishop and the
Recollects. Thus was conjured down one of the most bitter, as well as
the most needless, trivial and untimely of the quarrels that enliven
the annals of New France," ("Frontenac," p. 333.) Parkman tries to make
out a case, that "Tartuffe" was never meant to be acted and that it was
an elaborate joke on the part of Frontenac to frighten and annoy the
bishop. He does not succeed.

The unfortunate Mgr. de St. Vallier deserves not to be forgotten
at Montreal. He was most liberal with his private fortune, having
expended over 600,000 _livres_, of which 20,000 went to the Seminary
of Montreal. This side of his character has not been sufficiently
recognized. We have seen his interest in the establishment of the
Montreal schools; we have now to record his approval of the first
general hospital at Montreal, initiated by the Frères Charron or the
Hospitaliers of St. Joseph de la Croix. In 1692, on August 31, he wrote
to Frontenac and Champigny informing them of his intention to allow the
establishment of a hospital at Montreal following the authorization
and letters patent which he had already received from His Majesty. Its
object was to cope with the increased needs of the poor and sick of
the growing town. "In 1692," says Ferland, t. I-II, p. 267, "the Sieur
François Charron offered his fortune, which was considerable, for the
foundation of a general hospital.... Several persons, animated with the
same spirit, joined him, consecrated their wealth to the good work and
devoted themselves to the services of the poor.... On the request of
the Bishop of Quebec, the Governor and the Intendant, the King approved
in 1694 of this institution, which received the name of the 'Frères
Hospitaliers de St. Joseph de la Croix.'"[157]

Montreal is noted for its citizen charities. This may be reckoned one
of its first. In 1699 (May 30th) this hospital had letters patent to
establish manual instruction in trades and in arts. Later, in 1699, in
their collective letter of October 20th, addressed to the minister,
Callières and Champigny speak in high terms of this establishment. "A
house which will be very useful to the colony is that of the hospital
brothers established at Montreal. It has not yet cost the King or
country anything. However, it has done much good work. It has a hall
filled with the poor. They have commenced to draw here some persons
of distinction, of reduced and necessitous circumstances. They have
private rooms which are well looked after.... His Majesty is prayed to
accord them the exemption of duty on three tuns of _eau de vie_ and six
tuns of wine.... If His Majesty would have the goodness to add 1,000
_livres_ to aid them more easily to establish the _manufactures_ which
they have commenced, this will procure a great advantage to them and
the colony, because they will attract a number of poor young people to
receive employment." (Arch, Col. Canada Corresp. Gen., Vol. 17, fol.
3-17.)

This may be considered the first attempt at technical education
in Montreal and the origin of the "écoles des arts et métiers."
Unfortunately this establishment fell upon evil days in later days
and it was replaced by the Grey Sisters, who were founded by Madame
de Youville in 1748, to administer the General Hospital as shall be
told in its place. The site for the hospital was granted by Dollier de
Casson near Windmill Point, on the spot where the lately demolished
Grey Nuns' building stood. Its nine _arpents_ (acres) thus covered the
property adjoining the lower part of the present St. Peter Street, east
and west.

A glance around the town in the latter years of Frontenac's rule will
see the Sulpician Seigneurs consolidating their work, ministering to
the parishes on the island, providing chaplains to the Hôtel-Dieu and
the Congregation of Notre-Dame and instructing the Indians of the
mountain settlement and making good Frenchmen of their dark charges,
of whom there were 222 dwelling in their thirty-two _cabanes_.[158]
Meanwhile their seminary was being built, its foundations being laid
in 1685; it was not, however, completed till 1712. It was doing for
education in a smaller degree what the seminary was accomplishing at
Quebec.

[Illustration: GROUND PLAN OF THE SEMINARY OF MONTREAL]

[Illustration: SEMINARY OF MONTREAL

Residence seigneuriale and curiate of the Gentleman of the Seminary.
The erection of this residence dates from 1684. The principal side
of the building faces partly on Notre Dame Street and Place d'Armes
Square. It is ornamented by a clock (supposed to be the oldest in North
America), which is regulated by a chronometer and kept perfect time.
The building measures 178 feet front by 84 in depth.]

In the meantime the Sulpicians administered the island as its
seigneurs, though their duties as judges were gradually being
undertaken by the king's officers. By order of the king, March 15,
1693, "Royal Justice" was established; a "juge royal" was appointed
in the person of Jean Baptiste Migeon de Branssat, the nominee of
the seminary, and chosen as a mark of respect to the seigneurs. Four
_procureurs postulants_ with minor officers were also appointed by
the king to administer justice but there was still reserved to the
seigneurs within their enclosures of the seminary and the St. Gabriel
Farm the privileges of _haute, moyenne et basse_ justice. Nine years
later this decree was explained by an order of July, 1714, as not
meant to take away _basse_ justice from the ecclesiastics in the Isle
of Montreal; in addition it explained that in future they shall have
the same privilege in the newly established Côte St. Sulpice, the
Iles Courcelles and their other dependencies. This was to allow the
ecclesiastical seigneurs to create inferior judges for the recovery of
debts, _cens_ and _rentes_, fines, _lods_ and _ventes_, and all the
other rights and duties of feudal seigneurs, apart from the rights
relinquished as above noted.

The market place was busy and prosperous. Owing to the great number of
skins, the king, by a declaration of May 21, 1696, determined to limit
the number of permissions to trade with the Indians and gave order to
have delinquents condemned to the galleys. The number of beaver skins
now being taken to France exceeded the demand and to avoid too large a
quantity of inferior skins being sent, he gave orders that skins should
not be sold outside of the public market. About this time, there was
a general recall of officers, soldiers and _coureurs de bois_, and a
great desire to concentrate the people in the chief settlements and to
encourage the Indians to bring their peltries to Montreal.

The market place no doubt saw some strange sights. About 1695, in the
official record sent home to France, "Relation of the most remarkable
things," in that year, we are told that Frontenac once invited a band
of Ottawas who came to trade at Montreal to roast an Iroquois "newly
caught by the soldiers," but as they had hamstrung him to prevent his
escape he bled to death before the torture began. Next spring Callières
abandoned four Iroquois to be burned by the soldiers, _habitants_ and
Indian allies, in reprisal for the similar fate that befell two of the
Sault Indians at Michillimackinac. (Callières to the minister, October
20, 1696.) This now seems cruel, but at the time it appeared necessary
to thus impress the Iroquois with "the fear of the Lord." It was done
all over the country and thought righteous. La Motte-Cardillac, writing
on August 5, 1695, says: "If any more prisoners are brought me, I
promise you that their fate will be no sweeter."

By a writ of June 4, 1689, Louis Hector de Callières, the governor of
Montreal (1685-1698), had already received the appointment of commander
general of New France during the projected absence of M. de Frontenac.
Also in 1688, on March 8th, an order of the king gave him the command
of the troops in the absence of M. de Denonville, which indicated that
he was a "persona grata" and reserved for some higher post. On the
death of Frontenac, de Callières, who had been Frontenac's right-hand
man in his campaigns and had supported him in his Indian policy,
naturally assumed the government of Canada _ad interim_. De Callières
had every qualification for the position, having been opportunely
trained as an apprentice by his government of Montreal and as second
in command in the wars with the Iroquois. He was the man of the hour.
For as we know that, although by the peace of Ryswick hostilities had
ceased between the two colonial rival powers in North America, yet,
the Iroquois loudly protested their independence of the treaty and
were ever taking means to continue their warfare on Canada. Luckily,
like Frontenac, the new governor held the Iroquois in awe and respect
of him, a respect arising from his firmness in keeping his word and in
holding them to theirs. A solid and strong man was needed. De Callières
was this; and according to the Jesuit historian Charlevoix, "he had
straight and disinterested views, without prejudices and without
passions; a firmness always in accord with reason; a valour which
always knew how to moderate itself and render useful service; great
common sense, much uprightness and honour, a clear mental vision and
great application to duty, joined to great experience."[159] The same
writer also speaks of him as the most accomplished general the colony
had ever received and the man who had rendered the most important
services.

But Champigny, the intendant, and La Potherie, the controller of the
marine department in Canada, writing home at this period, say he was
haughty, ambitious, vain and fond of incense and flattery. Perhaps
they were jealous. La Potherie, writing on June 2, 1699, accuses the
governor _ad interim_ of wanting more honors paid to him than the
governor generals themselves, adding, "M. de Frontenac is no sooner
dead than the cockle is spread in this country. We have seen M. de
Callières take all of a sudden, a control so despotic that it seems as
if the intendant himself must obey him blindly." On his part Champigny
had never "seen such _hauteur_ since he had come to the colony."

All the same de Callières inaugurated his government by an honourable
and successful piece of statesmanship. Seeing that there was now by the
treaty of Ryswick (September 20, 1697), a temporary peace, at least,
between the English and the French, he desired to make all the Indians
of the north of America share in it--a no easy task, since the English
desired to keep the Iroquois in hostility toward the French still. It
was not for nearly two years after the overtures had commenced that
peace was definitely settled. In March, 1699, three Iroquois deputies
had arrived at Montreal before the death of Frontenac, and besides
desiring an exchange of prisoners, asked de Callières to conclude peace
at Albany. According to La Potherie, they asked for the Jesuits Bruyas
and Lamberville, for whom they had great esteem, to be sent with M. de
Maricourt for this purpose.

But de Callières, seeing through their ruse, that they wanted their
prisoners while they still would keep the French captives with the Five
Nations, firmly told them that the peace had to be signed at Montreal
and nowhere else. On July 18, 1700, a further embassy came to Montreal
with six Iroquois ambassadors, two from the Onondagas and four from the
Senecas, to pray the governor to send Father Bruyas and de Maricourt,
and in place of Father Lamberville, then in France, the interpreter,
Joncaire, who had married an Iroquois squaw and whose valour was
much respected by them, so that they might seek the French prisoners
themselves. The governor consented on condition that they should bring
back with the prisoners the ambassadors from Onneyout and Gogogouen,
with full powers to treat of peace. He did not speak of the others
of the Five Nations, e. g. the Agniers (Mohawks), who living near
Albany, were under English influence. The mission of Father Bruyas,
de Maricourt and Joncaire was successful, and towards the beginning
of September they returned with nineteen deputies from the country,
and but ten French prisoners, the rest either not being able to secure
their liberty, or preferring to adopt the Indian life.

On September 8th de Callières received the embassy in solemn audience,
when a provisional treaty of peace was signed by all the chiefs of
the tribes present. It was witnessed by the governor, intendant,
the ecclesiastical, civil and military authorities, the Hurons, the
Ottawas, the Abenakis and the Christian Iroquois from the missions
of the Mountain and of Sault St. Louis. The month of August of the
following year was appointed by de Callières for the final treaty to
be signed at Montreal, for he aimed at a general alliance with all
the Five Nations, to be preceded by a complete exchange of prisoners.
But would they ever return? The governor with his calm confidence
determined that they should and for this purpose he made use of the
missionaries. To prepare the minds of the people for peace, Father
de Bruyas, de Maricourt and Joncaire were again sent to Onondaga;
Father Enjalran and M. de Courtmanche to the nations above. Among the
Abenakis, Father Vincent Bigot, the Recollect Fathers in Acadia, and
Father Carheil at Michillimackinac, and others, were also to promote
the same great universal peace.

At last the great assembly opened at Montreal on July 25, 1701. Never
had there been seen such a representative union of the Five Nations.
There were present the Abenakis with Father Vincent Bigot; the Iroquois
with Father Bruyas; the Hurons with Father Garnier; the Ottawas
with Father Enjalran, and the Illinois and Miamis with the intrepid
voyageur, Nicolas Perrot. There were also the Christian Indians from
the mission settlements of Sault St. Louis, the Mountain, Lorette,
Sillery, of the River St. Francis and St. Francis de Sales with the
Algonquins, the Micmacs and many tribes from the west.

But all was not harmony; there were mutual recriminations and disputes
and it looked as if the treaty would never be signed, had not the Rat,
the Huron Chief Kondiaronk, swayed the minds of the assembly with his
eloquence and saved the peace. It was he who had formerly broken the
peace between Denonville and the Iroquois, but now he was to win the
undying gratitude of the French by his masterly and tragic espousal
of their cause. The historian Charlevoix speaking of Kondiaronk (Vol.
2, p. 278) says: "Never had savage more merit than he, a more noble
character, more valour, more prudence and more discernment in knowing
how to treat with others." He was so eloquent that he aroused the
plaudits even of his enemies and those jealous of him; since he had
so much intelligence and animation, he made such lively and witty
repartees, and had ever such ready reply, that he was the only man in
Canada who could cope with the Count de Frontenac. When the latter
wished to divert his officers he invited the Rat to his table. On his
side the Rat knew how to esteem his French contemporaries. "Among the
French," he said, "I know only two men of sense, the Count de Frontenac
and Father Carheil," the latter being the Jesuit missionary who had
converted him, and for whom he had the tenderest veneration.

Amid the havoc of dissentient voices at the great assembly, the Rat,
though suffering from great feebleness of health, demanded to be heard.
He was accorded an arm chair in the middle of the assemblage and all
drew near to hear him. "He spoke long," says Charlevoix, "and was
listened to with infinite attention. He explained the necessity of
peace, of the advantages accruing therefrom for the country in general
and each tribe in particular." The emotion he aroused was great and he
drew forth unanimous applause. But the brave orator had outpassed his
strength and his once vigorous constitution was now broken. At the end
of the discourse he was taken, a dying man, to the Hôtel-Dieu, where
he died the following night with sentiments of religious fervour and
fortified by the sacraments of the church.

His funeral obsequies were magnificent. He was buried in the parish
church and over his tomb was inscribed:

  "Ci-gît le Rat, Chef Huron"
  (Here lies the Huron Chieftain, the Rat.)

Four days after his death, on August 14th, the ceremony of the signing
of the peace took place. High placed on a dais sat the representative
of France, her lieutenant governor, M. de Callières, having by his side
the intendant, Champigny, the governor of Montreal, de Vaudreuil, and
principal officers of the county. Before him passed in single file all
the contracting nations. Then took place the exchange of prisoners.
The customary calumet of peace, was offered the Governor de Callières,
who after smoking it passed it on till it had circulated among the
encircling throng of Indian deputies. Thirty-eight of these then signed
singly, each his own peculiar mark, a bear for the Agniers (Mohawk), a
spider for the Onnontagues (Onondagas) and the Tsonnontouans (Senecas),
a beaver for the Hurons, a caribou for the Abenakis, for the Ottawas
a hare, etc. Then resounded the Te Deum of thanksgiving and the
assemblage dispersed to be regaled by a grand and monstrous banquet,
with salvos of artillery and fireworks, to terminate this auspicious
day.

[Illustration: SOME SIGNATURES OF THE INDIAN CHIEFS AT THE GREAT PEACE]

It was a momentous occasion. It was looked upon as the triumph of
civilization and Christianity over barbarism and paganism. Montreal, so
long the beleaguered outpost, the scene of many a bloody onslaught and
carnage, was fittingly the arena of the joyous peace celebrations of
that evening of August 14, 1701, heralding brighter days for the colony.

In the meantime, while the Indians were gathering at Montreal for the
conclusion of the peace, a body of fifty regular soldiers and fifty
Canadians left Lachine on June 1, 1701, under the command of Antoine
de la Motte-Cardillac and accompanied by Capt. Alphonse de Tonti,
the younger brother of Henri de Tonti, and the Lieutenants Dugué and
Chacornelle. Not to draw the attention of the Iroquois, the expedition
ascended the Ottawa River, entered Lake Huron and thence proceeded to
Détroit to the new fort of Pontchartrain (or Détroit) rapidly rising
and situated on the strait (Détroit) between Lakes Erie and Huron.

The establishment of this fort was the great desire of la
Motte-Cardillac, for he deemed it of utmost importance and had obtained
the permission from the secretary of the marine, Jérome Count de
Pontchartrain. It secured the communications of the colony with the
countries of the Miamis and the Illinois, and thence with Louisiana
by the Mississippi. It was the key of the three upper lakes, a most
desirable possession for the French. Moreover the climate of the strait
was pleasant, the air healthful, the soil excellent and fruitful, and
the hunting good. Incidentally the commandant saw an opportunity of
enriching himself. But, to make such a settlement profitable, it was
necessary to induce the Indians to settle there. At the congress of
Montreal, the Governor de Callières, who had at first been hostile to
the settlement of Détroit, as he feared with others like Champigny
that it would be the ruin of Michillimackinac, invited the Hurons and
Ottawas of Michillimackinac then present to change over to the new
fort, and finally many of them did so. Thus was born the germ of the
present Détroit.

Its founder was a familiar figure in Montreal. Antoine de la
Motte-Cardillac belonged to a good family of Languedoc. At first a
cadet in the regiment of Dampierre-Lorraine, then lieutenant in that of
Clairembault, he passed over into Canada about 1683, desirous of making
his fortune, being then not more than twenty-three years of age. His
ready wit, intelligence, active ambition and never failing humour soon
saw him advanced to a lieutenancy in the colonial troops, then to the
rank of ensign of the navy and captain of the troops. Being a thorough
Gascon, he gained the confidence of Frontenac, especially as he had no
great love for the clergy, particularly the Jesuits. He was a railler,
a skeptic and a critic of religion and morality, but knew how to play
the game to suit his interests. He had undoubted ability and he acted
as the ready tool of Frontenac. On September 16, 1694, he became the
governor of Michillimackinac following Durantaye, and de Louvigny de la
Port. His reign there was marked with the abuses prevalent among the
trading posts of the period, where private commerce and self-interest
among the soldiers were of more importance than the good of the natives
or the development of the country. His frequent mêlées with the
Jesuits, about whom he related contrary accusations of self-interested
trading, brought it about that the French court determined to abandon
Michillimackinac and when the order was rescinded, La Motte was so
chagrined that finding it no longer likely to serve his interests, he
refused to return there, being replaced by Alphonse de Tonti. Instead,
he went to France to justify himself and to push the establishment
of Fort Pontchartrain or Détroit as narrated, for he considered that
wealth was in store for Détroit if the fur trade was restricted
to it as he desired. This was likely to happen, for the policy of
concentration was then in the ascendant, it being intended that the
trade should seek the cities, while the western posts were being
discouraged. Eventually the new trading company, which had been founded
in October by the _habitants_ of the colony for the exploitation of the
beaver traffic and had most of the principal men as its shareholders,
among them being many Montrealers who desired to concentrate the peltry
trade towards Montreal, was restricted to Forts Frontenac and Détroit
of the western forts. Finally, owing to trouble with the directors of
the company, whom he bitterly accused of no desire but for gain, so
that the fields were not sown and the cattle were destroyed, Détroit
was handed over to Cardillac as commandant. But his ambitions were
clipped, for by the ordinances of June, 1706, he could not trade in
castors to more than fifteen to twenty thousand _livres_ a year, so
as not to increase the number of beaver skins, with which the company
was already overloaded. He was forbidden, moreover, to trade except in
his fort. His voluminous letters of this period are full of complaints
against the Jesuits, the company and the head of the government. Thus
Détroit struggled through a critical infancy but was gaining strength
so that it had reached 200 souls, when its founder,[160] by letters
of May 10, 1710, was appointed governor of Louisiana to succeed de
Bienville.

On the first day of January, 1700, Marguerite Bourgeoys, now in her
eightieth year, passed into her agony and on the 12th breathed her
last, surrounded by the community she had founded and whose rule of
life had at last been approved by Bishop St. Vallier on June 24, 1696.
The funeral, which took place on January 13th in the parish church,
was attended by all classes of Montreal from the governor general
down to the simplest _habitant_, for she had been looked upon as the
universal mother of the community. The vicar general of the diocese
and the superior of the seminary, the aged Dollier de Casson, now bent
under the weight of fourscore years of life and labours, pronounced
the funeral oration. On the tablet of steel placed on the coffin, the
epitaph ordered by him read as follows:

            Here lies Sister Marguerite Bourgeoys, Teacher,
          Founder and First Superior of the Congregation of
          Notre-Dame, established in the Island of Montreal
            for the instruction of girls in town or country,
              Deceased on the 12th of January, 1700.
                Pray for the repose of her soul!

Thirty days after the death of Marguerite Bourgeoys a solemn requiem
was chanted in the Congregation Church and an eloquent panegyric was
delivered by M. de Belmont. After mass the preacher carried the heart
of the deceased founder, embalmed in a leaden box, to a shrine prepared
in a niche, and solemnly blessed the resting place and then closed the
opening with a leaden slab, over which lay a copper tablet, bearing the
following lines in French:

    "Beneath this stone is hid a heart
    To flesh a foe, from earth apart,
    Its treasure sole, the virgin band
    Its zeal had gathered in this land."[161]

Then her daughters hung her portrait over the shrine. For sixty-eight
years the sacred relics remained there until a fire broke out in
the church and convent of the congregation on April 11, 1768, when
the ashes were recovered and placed in a silver box that is still
preserved. The memory of the saintly life of Mother Bourgeoys remained
long in the land. On December 7, 1878, in the opening years of the
pontificate of Leo XIII, a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites,
at Rome, pronounced Marguerite Bourgeoys, Venerable. The title of
"Blessed" was pronounced by Pius X. Her daughters look forward to the
day when she may be invoked by them as St. Margaret of Canada.

Thus passed away one of the earliest figures of the infant colony of
Montreal. We may aptly quote Parkman's tribute to this saintly woman:
"To this day in crowded schoolrooms of Montreal and Quebec,[162] fit
monuments of her unobtrusive virtue, her successors instruct the
children of the poor, and embalm the pleasant memories of Margaret
Bourgeois. In the martial figure of Maisonneuve and the fair form of
this gentle nun, we find the true heroes of Montreal." (Jesuits, p.
202.)

     COMMEMORATION--PEACE OF UTRECHT--COMPARISON BETWEEN NEW ENGLAND
     AND NEW FRANCE. NOTE: THE CHATEAU DE RAMEZAY.


The peace of Ryswick, signed September 20, 1697, was only a temporary
lull. Queen Anne began to reign in England on March 8, 1702, and
another war with France, that known as Queen Anne's war or the war
of the Spanish succession, was declared on the 4th of May, 1702. But
it can be said that in Canada the English were not always the guilty
causes. The Canadians, even before the declaration, were not adverse
to war, as they considered themselves more warlike, better disciplined
and could rely on their Indian allies since the peace of 1701. They
held the "New Englanders"--a term often applied by them to the British
colonists in general--as an easy mark. In their mind's eye they already
saw themselves in possession of Boston and New York. Even Le Moyne
d'Iberville had such visions and drew up a memoir on the project. On
their side the greater number of the English colonists were not anxious
for hostilities. Certainly not the New York and Albany Dutchmen, who
feared for their trade. Meanwhile the borders of Massachusetts and New
Hampshire were the theatre of war. An interesting light is thrown on
the subject in the abstract of a dispatch, sent by M. de Vaudreuil, now
governor, and M. Beauharnois, November 15, 1703, to be found in the
state documents of New York (Doc. Col. Hist. N. Y., IX, p. 755). The
minister, Pontchartrain, after the French attack on Wells and other
places under Beaubassin, in 1703, has annotated the abstract thus: "It
would have been desirable that this expedition had not taken place. M.
de Vaudreuil was wishing for it in M. de Callières' time, who would
never consent to it. I have a perfect knowledge that the English only
want peace, aware that war is contrary to the interests of all the
colonies; _the French have always commenced hostilities in Canada_."
Yet Pontchartrain later, when the suffering English retaliated by
planning the invasion of Canada, naturally enough was ready to counsel
war parties against them.

In 1705 we find Samuel Vetch in Montreal. He had come on a diplomatic
mission on the part of Massachusetts. He remained at Quebec from August
to the middle of October, having ascended the St. Lawrence to reach
the city and returning the same way. He kept his eyes open, and having
been educated at Utrecht, he probably knew French, so that he likely
discussed Canadian affairs. He boasted afterwards of the completeness
of his knowledge of Canada and he made use of it. "Vetch visited
Montreal and its governor, de Ramezay, wrote to the minister on the
subject, complaining that in Quebec he had been left at liberty to
obtain all the information desired; whereas in Montreal, de Ramezay
himself had taken care that he should always be accompanied by an
officer and an interpreter. There had been old dealings between Vetch
and de Ramezay. Vetch, when engaged in his commercial operations
for years previously, had advanced de Ramezay the amount of his
appointments, paying him in card currency, and had received authority
to draw his money in France. The war broke out and the power to obtain
the money had been given by de Ramezay to another person in France.
It was the object of Vetch in visiting Montreal to be repaid this
advance, but de Ramezay professed himself not in the condition to give
it back, without the approval of the minister."--Kingsford ("History of
Canada"), II, p. 429.

About 1708 the conquest of Canada was designed as a means of bringing
the struggles of the English colonists of North America in their desire
for supremacy to a close. To the charge of this bold venture Samuel
Vetch was appointed, an energetic, astute and ambitious agent for his
party, who boasted he knew the St. Lawrence and its shores better than
the Canadians themselves. His visit to Montreal had not been in vain.
On March 11, 1709, he sailed from England, whither he had gone from
the general court of Massachusetts to ask for aid from Queen Anne's
government. A squadron bearing five regiments of regular troops was
promised. The colonies, too, had to muster their forces, and the plan
was to attack Montreal, advancing by way of Wood Creek, Lake Champlain
and Chambly on the Richelieu, and to take Quebec by way of the St.
Lawrence. The command of the advance on Montreal was entrusted to Col.
Francis Nicholson, late lieutenant governor of New York, who had sailed
from Portsmouth with Vetch. Nicholson was to proceed to Montreal and
wait there until the promised British squadron should arrive at Boston
about May.

News of his approach to Wood Creek reaching de Vaudreuil, he sent de
Ramezay, the governor of Montreal, with 1,500 Canadians and Indians to
surprise his camp. Montreal and Quebec were meanwhile in the greatest
consternation, brought on by most exaggerated reports. Nothing less
than the total conquest of the colony was feared. The result of the
expedition led by the governor of Montreal may be told by Parkman ("A
Half Century of Conflict," Chapter VII), relying on state documents of
this year, 1709:

"Ramezay's fleet of canoes had reached Lake Champlain and was half way
to the mouth of Wood Creek, when his advance party was discovered by
English scouts, and the French commander began to fear that he should
be surprised in turn; in fact some of his Indians were fired upon from
an ambuscade. All was now doubt, perplexity and confusion. Ramezay
landed at the narrows of the lake, a little south of the place now
called Crown Point. Here in the dense woods, his Indians fired on some
Canadians whom they took for English. This was near producing a panic.
'Every tree seemed an enemy,' writes an officer present. Ramezay lost
himself in the woods and could not find his army. One Deruisseau, who
had gone out as a scout, came back with the report that 900 Englishmen
were close at hand. Seven English canoes did in fact appear, supported,
as the French in their excitement imagined, by a numerous though
invisible army in the forest; but being fired upon, and seeing they
were entering a hornet's nest, the English sheered off, Ramezay having
at last found his army, and order being gradually restored, a council
of war was held, after which the whole force fell back to Chambly,
having accomplished nothing."

Yet the advance on Montreal never went beyond Wood Creek. While waiting
months and weeks for the order from Boston to proceed to Montreal,
Nicholson's little army succumbed to the attacks of pestilence,
probably a malignant dysentery, caused by being long penned up in an
insanitary palisaded camp during the midsummer heat. It is said on the
authority of Charlevoix, that the Iroquois had poisoned the waters of
the creek, by throwing into it, above the camp, the skins and offal
of the animals they had killed in their hunting. Whatever the cause,
when a party of French came later upon the scene they found innumerable
graves. The remnant of Nicholson's army turned back, as the British
squadron was countermanded for Portugal, where British interests needed
it. Thus was Montreal saved and with it Quebec.

In 1711, however, Nicholson was again attempting to move against
Montreal. Again great consternation prevailed in the town, for the news
had reached Canada early in August, when Vaudreuil had been informed
by de Cortebelle, the French commandant at Placentia in Newfoundland,
that English prisoners had reported mighty preparations being made
by the "Bostonnais" against Quebec by water and Montreal by land.
Dismay and confusion seized both towns. Montreal, fortified only by
its palisade of stakes and incapable of resisting the artillery of the
English invaders, believed that it was on the eve of its death throes,
seeing that an army was setting out from New York with 3,000 men with
cannons. In these straits the people turned to God, and the priests
of St. Sulpice preached penitence to them. The chronicles of the time
tell how hearts were moved, how there were penitential processions, in
which all the Montrealers joined barefooted and with cords around their
necks; it was a time of general communions, voluntary fasting and like
mortifications.

Mother Juchereau in the annals of the Hôtel-Dieu of Quebec confesses
that "the ladies of Montreal outbid those of Quebec, for the former
obliged themselves not to wear ribbons or laces for a year,"--no small
sacrifice, doubtlessly. Finally, the young "externe" ladies of the
Congregation and others, made a vow that if they were saved from the
evils apprehended, seemingly inevitable, they would build in honour
of the Mother of God a chapel under the name of Our Lady of Victory.
Meanwhile in her self-imposed retirement Jeanne LeBer, the recluse, was
acquainted of the disasters impending, and her prayers were besought on
all hands. Even the Baron de Longueuil, then governor of the town, and
surnamed the "Macchabbeus of Montreal" prevailed on her to compose a
prayer which should be inscribed on his standard, which he would take
with a handful of men, to prepare, in their desperation, an ambuscade
near Chambly, by which Nicholson's men were expected to pass. The
recluse, thus prevailed on by her cousin, wrote this inscription: "_Our
enemies place all their confidence in their arms, but we place ours
under the name of the Queen of Angels, whom we invoke. She is terrible
as an army in battle array; under her protection we hope to conquer our
enemies._" The standard was solemnly blessed and put into the hands of
M. de Longueuil by M. de Belmont, in the parish church of Notre Dame,
whither all the people had gathered for this edifying spectacle.

Bearing this ensign himself, M. de Longueuil set out to encounter
General Nicholson's land force, but the latter now retreated, on
hearing of the disastrous termination of the expedition of the fleet
making for the capture of Quebec. Not finding Nicholson's forces, and
ignorant as yet of the cause of his retreat, the Montrealers journeyed
down to Quebec to assist that town against the attack by water. There
they waited till in the middle of October, when on the 19th the Sieur
de la Valterie, who had come from Labrador in September and had been
sent down the river again by de Vaudreuil to watch for the English
fleet, appeared at Quebec with tidings of joy.

The deposition of François de Marganne, Sieur de la Valterie, before
Paul Dupuy, Esquire, king's councillor, on October 19th, relates that,
"he had descended the St. Lawrence in a canoe, with two Frenchmen and
an Indian, till landing at the Ile aux Oeufs on the 1st of October,
they met two French sailors or fishermen loaded with plunder and
presently discovered the wrecks of seven English ships, with, as they
declared, fifteen or sixteen hundred dead bodies, on the strand hard
by, besides dead horses, sheep, dogs and hens, three or four hundred
large iron-hooped casks, a barrel of wine and a barrel and keg of
brandy, cables, anchors, chains, planks, boards, shovels, picks,
mattocks and piles of old iron three feet high." (Parkman, "A Half
Century of Conflict.") Later visits to the wrecks brought back news
that, though the autumn tides had swept away many corpses, more than
two thousand lay on the rocks, naked and in attitudes of despair. Denys
de la Ronde, writing to the minister on December 30, 1711, says that
nearly one thousand men were drowned, and about two thousand died of
injuries. Whatever there is of exaggeration in this, still Colonel Lee
of the Rhode Island contingent, writing to Governor Cranston, September
12, 1711, says that a day or two after the wreck, he saw "the bodies of
twelve or thirteen hundred brave men, with women and children, lying in
heaps."

So perished the ill-fated expedition under Admiral Sir Hovenden
Walker, that was to have subjugated Canada. The fleet, which set sail
from Boston on July 30th "consisted of nine ships of war and two bomb
ketches with about sixty transports, store ships, hospital ships and
other vessels, British and Provincial. They carried the seven British
regiments, numbering with the artillery train about five thousand five
hundred men, besides 600 marines and 1,500 provincials; counting with
the sailors nearly twelve thousand in all." Samuel Vetch commanded the
provincials--the same who had boasted of his knowledge of the Canadian
coasts; but he was no sailor, and the pilots with the fleet had little
serious knowledge of the St. Lawrence after all.

How this mighty expedition met disaster at the mercy of the elements
leads us too far from Montreal to tell. Suffice it to say that Quebec
and Montreal were saved.[163]

The dramatic routing of their enemies was regarded by Canadians as
a manifest effect of Divine Providence watching over them. M. de
Vaudreuil, writing to the minister on October 22, and November 6, 1712,
says: "We are going to give thanks to God for the visible protection
which he benignantly granted to this country. All our people, though
well determined to defend themselves, agree that God has granted them
great favours in the destruction of the English fleet, without it
costing a single drop of blood to this colony." In his "Life of Sieur
LeBer," M. de Belmont claimed that the Mother of God obtained for the
Canadians this greatest miracle, "which has happened since the time of
Moses when the Egyptians were swallowed up in the waters of the Red
Sea." At Montreal, in thanksgiving, the ladies set about to procure the
necessary funds to redeem their vows. The Sisters of the Congregation
gave a plot of ground within their enclosure, near to their church,
and in 1718 the foundation stone of the little shrine of "Our Lady of
Victories" was ceremoniously laid.[164]

[Illustration: CHURCH OF OUR LADY OF VICTORY]

Peace for the two great rival nations was obtained by the treaty of
Utrecht on April 13, 1713. But it was not without a pang for the old
King Louis XIV, who lost fair jewels from his crown, in then ceding
to the English, Acadia, Newfoundland, Hudson's Bay and the Iroquois
country. To France was reserved only Prince Edward Island and the
adjoining islands, and Cape Breton. "The treaty of Utrecht," says
Ganneau, "was followed by a period of peace almost without example in
the annals of Canada." The whole colony increased in population, the
Island of Montreal growing from 3,492 souls in 1710 to 7,710 in 1740.

Montreal profited by the peace less advantageously than Quebec and
Three Rivers. Formerly this town was the principal headquarters of the
fur trade, as we have seen. But after the treaty of Utrecht, by the
loss to the French of the Hudson's Bay trade, New York at last gained
considerably over Montreal. Yet none the less, prosperity ruled there.

An interesting comparison of the two great races contending at this
time for the mastery of the north of this continent may be here quoted
from the "Journal d'un voyage en Amérique," Vol. V, published in 1744,
and written by the Jesuit historian of Canada, Charlevoix. He is
describing the condition prevailing about this period. "There reigns
in New England and in the other provinces of the Continent of America,
belonging to the British Empire, an opulence which, it seems, they
do not know how to profit by; while in New France there is poverty
hidden by an appearance of easy circumstances, which appears unstudied;
commerce and cultivation of the plantations strengthen the first, the
industry of the inhabitants sustain the second, and the taste of the
people spreads around infinite comfort. The English colonist amasses
wealth and makes no superfluous expenditure; the Frenchman enjoys what
he has and often makes a parade of what he has not. The former labours
for his heirs, while the latter leaves his in the same necessity in
which he finds himself, allowing them to get out of the situation as
well as they can. The English Americans do not desire war, because they
have much to lose; they do not humour the savages, because they do not
believe they have any need of them. The French youths for contrary
reasons detest peace and live on good terms with the aborigines of the
country, whose esteem they easily secure during periods of war, as well
as their friendship at all times."


NOTE

THE CHATEAU DE RAMEZAY

Claude de Ramezay, eleventh governor of Montreal, appointed 1703, was
born in France, 1657, and came to Canada in 1685, with a number of
other young officers, in the suite of Governor de Denonville. He was
then a lieutenant in de Troye's company of marine troops, which later
took part in the expedition to Hudson's Bay. His promotion was rapid,
being captain in 1687, later colonel, then commandant of troops, and
finally governor of the town and its district.

In 1687 he took part in the expedition against the Iroquois and in
1690, when Phipps appeared before Quebec, he brought over 800 men from
Montreal for the defense of the former town.

History tells of the spirited defense made by Frontenac and his gallant
officers, the latter, no doubt, being encouraged by the bright smiles
of some of Quebec's fair daughters who, it seems, lost no time in
rewarding their brave defenders with their heart and hand. Scarcely
had the last of Phipp's fleet disappeared around Point Levi, than
de Ramezay led to the altar Melle Marie-Charlotte Denys, a daughter
of Denys de la Ronde, one of the wealthiest families of Canada. His
companion in arms, de Vaudreuil, at the same time married Louise,
daughter of Pierre de Joybert de Soulanges. Could they have seen into
the future their happiness would have been clouded by sorrow, for it
was destined that a son of de Ramezay should be the one to open the
gates of Quebec to the English in 1759, and a son of de Vaudreuil
should do likewise, at Montreal, the following year.

De Ramezay was one of the most prominent men of this time, occupying
an official position in Canada for a term exceeding forty years. He
was Seigneur de la Gesse, de Montigny, et Boisfleurent in France,
and in Canada was Seigneur de Monnoir and de Ramezay, Knight of the
Military Order of St. Louis, governor of Montreal, and commandant
of all the militia in the country, and was administrator of the
governor-generalship during the two years' absence of de Vaudreuil in
France.

The château was built in 1705. It is a long, low, cottage-built
building, standing quaintly out of date before the city hall. The
neighborhood was then the fashionable part of the town, and was
occupied by the Baron de Longueuil, the Contrecoeurs, d'Eschambaults,
d'Aillebousts and Madame de Portneuf, the widow of Baron Becancourt.
Situated on a hill, and opposite to the magnificent garden of the
Jesuits, this plain unembellished house had an open view to the river
front. The vaults were of ancient castle construction. Even the attic
floors were of stone slabs.

HOUSE]

[Illustration: ORIGINAL MANTEL PIECE]

Under de Ramezay's régime, 1703 to 1724, this venerable edifice was
the hall of entertainment of the illustrious of the country. The many
expeditions to the distant fur fields, the voyages of discovery of new
lands, the councils of war, the military expeditions, the conferences
with the Indians, the annual fairs and fur trading market, attracted to
the shores of Montreal not only the governor general, the intendant,
and their suites, but a considerable number of the most important
people of the country, including all classes of society. To one and all
the portals of this hospitable mansion were ever open. To the lowly
Indian and his squaw, and to the exalted nobleman and his consort, the
noble and beneficent Ramezay and his family showed equal attention.
Fearless to the Indian or enemy, his bravery and charity were equally
exemplified in the personal care and attention he and his family gave
to the suffering citizens of Montreal during the pest which devastated
the town in 1721.

De Ramezay died in 1724, and his family sold the château to the
_Compagnie des Indes_ in 1745. The latter retained possession until the
cession in 1763, when it was bought by William Grant, who, in turn,
disposed of it to the English government for the sum of 2,000 guineas.
It thus became again the residence of the governors, and remained such
up to 1849.

In 1775-6 the château was the headquarters for the Continental Army
under Montgomery, and in the spring of 1776 there came Benjamin
Franklin, Carroll of Carrollton, and Samuel Chase, envoys sent by
Congress to influence the French Canadians to join the colonies in the
revolt against British rule. Then came Benedict Arnold, who occupied
the château for several weeks. The mark of the old reception dias is
still seen on the salon walls.

Lord Metcalfe was the last resident governor, but for some years after
his establishment in a new government house the château was used for
departmental offices. When the government was withdrawn from Montreal,
the château served several purposes. For some years courts were held
here, and later the normal school, then courts again.

In 1894 the château was sold by the Provincial government and purchased
by the Corporation of the City of Montreal for the Numismatic and
Antiquarian Society, which in 1895 obtained the building for the
purpose of founding their historical portrait gallery and museum.

Next to the Château de Ramezay on the west stood the house of the Baron
de Becancourt, built at the beginning of the 18th century. It also
passed into the hands of the _Compagnie des Indes_, and became their
_commissariat_. In 1800 this building came into the possession of the
McGill family and was long known as the "Old McGill House."

Having already recorded the treaty with the Indians in 1701, and the
history of Queen Anne's war which terminated in the peace of Utrecht,
we may now survey in several chapters the civil progress of Montreal
from the beginning of the eighteenth century and during the long peace
which lasted to the beginning of the final war with the English, which
ended in the capitulation of Montreal in 1760.

M. Philippe de Rigaud Marquis de Vaudreuil, as governor of Montreal
(1698-1703), early renewed some of the old trouble of infringing on
the authority of the governor general, for in 1700, on May 5th, the
king's minister wrote to Vaudreuil that His Majesty did not wish
him to interfere directly or indirectly in the administration of
justice, nor would the king pardon him for putting the inhabitants
in prison without the orders of M. de Callières.[165] Otherwise the
ordinary administration of the town progressed. We have preserved the
granting of a Montreal tavern license from May 5th to Pierre Billeron
de Lafatigue and Marie Fortier, his wife, to sell and retail drinks,
_a pot et a pinte_," and refreshments _par assiette_" (plate), with
the injunction, "not to intoxicate the savages, and to make observed
among them the regulations of our seigneurs of the council, with
the prohibition of giving drink and food during the celebration of
divine service or past 9 o'clock in the evening." License holders
were to allow the police to inspect and they were to keep copies
of these regulations posted in their inns. The civil, military and
ecclesiastical hours of the day were told by the parish church clock,
which had existed up to 1701; its remains were found in a lumber room
in 1770. But about 1701, the superior of the seminary, M. de Belmont,
brought from France the famous timepiece at the cost of 800 francs,
about the value of the same number of dollars nowadays. In 1751 it got
out of order for the first time but it was thoroughly renovated during
Montgolfiers' rule of the seminary and it served faithfully as the only
public clock till recent times.[166]

A permit to marry, granted by de Callières to a soldier coming to the
Montreal district, and dated from Quebec, January 7, 1702, gives us a
glimpse of the military jurisdiction of the time. "We give permission
to one named Poitevin, a soldier of the company of Longueuil, to
espouse the daughter of Julien Blois of Long point. The civic seigneur
will not make any difficulty in marrying them.

                    "(Signed) Le Chevalier de Callières."

At this time M. de Vaudreuil was thinking of building his château
in Montreal, and on May 6th, the minister writes to the Intendant
Champigny "that the King has granted 1,000 _livres_ to help M. de
Vaudreuil to build his home." On the same day he wrote to the latter
telling him "that as the inhabitants of Montreal are too far from the
sea to take up the fishery industry otherwise than by associating
themselves with those of Quebec, he should urge his people to the
cultivation of the soil and especially of hemp, which the Kingdom
of France has to import from the northern countries." On the same
day, the minister wrote to de Ramezay,[167] who had recently arrived,
congratulating him on the good condition of the 300 recruits taken by
him from France. M. de Ramezay at the same time was appointed, in the
absence of de Callières and de Vaudreuil, to the command of the whole
extent of the colony, thus clearly designating him for future honours.

Montreal's destiny as the head of navigation was early forced upon the
attention of the enterprising missionaries and traders who embarked
from Montreal for the West. The rapids of the Sault St. Louis presented
an initial difficulty, and eyes had long been cast on the possibility
of avoiding them by constructing a canal, connecting the _lac à loutre_
on the west side, by a channel, to the Lake St. Louis, so that canoes
could start from the Little River St. Pierre, near Place Royale, and
pursue their way inland and westward until they reached the Lake St.
Louis. Thus, therefore, was evolved the first attempt at a Lachine
Canal in 1700.

M. Ernest Marceau in 1906 gave the results of some of his
investigations among the papers of the Sulpicians, for the history of
the efforts of the seigneurs of Montreal to overcome the difficulties
of the navigation between Lachine and Montreal. He relates these as
follows:[168]

"A few years only had elapsed since the establishment of the
French at Montreal, when the necessity for bettering the means of
communication between the rising city and the settlements already
existing at Lachine, Ste. Anne, etc., became apparent. The young colony
was too poor, however, to think of building a canal with locks to
overcome the very considerable fall in the nine miles of river from
Pointe-à-Callières to Lachine.

"The route followed by the canoes at the time was along the north
shore of the St. Lawrence, but it was exceedingly dangerous, and
many portages intervened between navigable stretches. Even in these
so-called navigable stretches, towing had to be resorted to. A number
of accidents had already happened, in which men and canoes had been
lost. In the year 1700, the Superior of the Sulpicians, Mr. Dollier
de Casson,[169] undertook to improve the Little River St. Pierre, and
to make it navigable for canoes, from its mouth to Lake St. Pierre, a
shallow body of water lying about half way between Montreal and Lachine
(this lake has long disappeared, owing chiefly to the works done in
connection with the Lachine Canal), and to open up a cut from the lake
to a point on the St. Lawrence above the worst part of the rapids.

[Illustration: CHART OF A PART OF THE ISLAND OF MONTREAL SHOWING THE
LACHINE CANAL

(La Morandière)]

"A notarial contract was passed, between the contractor, Gédéon de
Catalogne,[170] and Mr. Dollier de Casson, for the excavation of a canal
twenty-four arpents, or about one mile, in length, twelve feet wide
at the surface of the ground, and of varying width at the bottom,
according to the depth of cutting. The water flowing through the canal
was to be at least eighteen inches deep, at the period of lowest water
in the St. Lawrence.

"The work was begun in October, 1700, and in February of the year
following the contractor failed, after having performed the greater
part of his contract, the whole of the cut being completed at the time,
except for a depth of three or four feet on some 2,400 feet in length.

"The canal was excavated for about one-third of its length through clay
mixed with boulders, the balance being through quarry rock.

"A settlement was made with the contractor in the Spring, the amount
paid being 12,500 _livres_, which represents about $15,000 of our
present currency.

[Illustration: MAISON DE CATALOGNE, RUE ST. VINCENT]

[Illustration: This house commonly reputed in late years to be that of
a rich trader, Charles Hubert _dit_ Lacroix, cannot be substantiated as
such by any document. What is true is that the house is built on the
original concession to Nicholas Hubert _dit_ Lacroix, a tailor of some
civic distinction, who appears in Montreal for the first time in 1655.
Houses then were built of logs. To archæologists the house appears to
have been built at the same period as the Château de Ramezay, in the
first part of the eighteenth century. The interior decorations are of
a later period.]

"The work was left in this unfinished condition, notwithstanding the
repeated attempts to push it to completion, the Sulpicians' revenues,
which were very unimportant at that time, finding better use in other
directions.

"In 1708, Louis XIV ordered plans and estimates of the work to be
submitted to him, the undertaking having been recognized as devolving
upon the royal authorities, but, owing to the conditions of affairs in
France during the latter part of the reign, the scheme had to be again
postponed.

"Almost every year after this, the Canal de la Chine is mentioned in
the correspondence between the superiors of the Montreal house and the
head of the Sulpician Order in Paris, as also in letters addressed to
the Governors of the colony.

"In 1717, Mr. Chaussegros de Léry, who had charge of all military and
civil engineering works in Montreal, reported that three-fourths of the
work was done. The Crown could not yet at the time give the necessary
help to perfect the canal, but instructions were given not to abandon
the idea.

"Again in 1733, the same engineer made a complete survey of the route
and prepared fresh plans and estimates. The old line had evidently been
abandoned, as the probable cost of the work is put down at 255,000
_livres_, or about $300,000. The new scheme contemplated a canal with
locks. Unfortunately, no copy of the report of Mr. Chaussegros is on
record in the documents referred to.

"From that date nothing can be found in the Seminary papers relating
to the canal, which would seem to indicate that the work was never
completed. It is quite likely, however, that the imperfect channel
could be used by canoes during the periods of high water. Be that as
it may, traces of it in the shape of a half-filled ditch, are still
to be seen in a field near the Canadian Pacific Railway embankment at
Rockfield."

In the year 1703, on May 26th, de Callières died, and M. de Vaudreuil
succeeded him on August 1st as governor general, while M. Claude de
Ramezay replaced the latter as governor of Montreal, being appointed by
the king as such in August. The minister, this same month recommended
de Vaudreuil, Beauharnois and the Marquis d'Alogny to make use of his
advice in regard to the police and the management of the troops.

In 1704 we hear of an ordinance of the Governor General de Vaudreuil,
dated December 12th, being sent to Montreal to forbid seditious
assemblies. It had been brought to his notice that there had been a
large gathering of the inhabitants near Montreal for the purpose of
obliging the merchants to furnish them salt and other merchandise at a
lower price. But on the explanation of the Governor de Ramezay and the
superior of the seminary, M. de Belmont, that there had been nothing
seditious in the meeting which had been called simply to protest and
to draw attention to their complaints, things went no further than the
issue of the ordinance, although the "meeting" was still the subject
of letters to France in 1705. In that year de Ramezay had been having
his troubles with the authorities of Quebec. In a letter from the
minister (Pontchartrain) the latter strongly disapproves of his conduct
in heading a cabal against de Vaudreuil and Beauharnois, and of the
impropriety of raising himself up as a reformer of the higher powers of
the colony.

An insight into the hardships experienced at Montreal as a result of
the wars with the English colonies, may now be presented. The vessel,
La Seine, which was carrying to Canada provisions and merchandise of
all kinds and the cargo of which was estimated at a million _livres_
(_tournois_), left Rochelle in the summer of 1705 and was captured by
a Virginian fleet in spite of the heroic resistance of the Chevalier
de Maupeon. The vessel was seized and its passengers, among whom was
Mgr. de St. Vallier, were taken as prisoners to England. Such and
similar disasters made living conditions dear at Montreal and famine
was frequent. A missionary of this period says that wearing apparel and
houses were of an extraordinary price at Montreal. The innkeepers made
their fortune in diluting the drink, especially that which they sold to
the Indians, who drank all that they could get, in exchange for their
peltry. "You have served me out of the savages' barrel," grumbled one
of the workmen to the servant who had just given him some liquor.

The scarcity of clothing material, caused by the loss of La Seine,
brought with it, however, an advantage to the colony. On the suggestion
of the Intendant Raudot, the king's council permitted the inhabitants
to make linen and druggets with the homemade yarn and worsted of the
country. For hitherto France had insisted on the right of supplying
Canada with its manufactured articles. It forbade home industries.
Even the wool gathered on the St. Lawrence banks was shipped to France
and returned in the form of a coarse cloth. All clothing therefore had
been very expensive in the colony. Necessity became, therefore, the
mother of invention and we thus find Madame de Repentigny, who had
greatly contributed to the progress of this industry, writing in 1708:
"There is at present a considerable quantity of handicrafts which work
at making linen in Canada. Women and men work at them. The men have a
taste for deerskin clothing, which costs them much less than the cloths
from France; they nearly all wear it with homemade drugget _surtouts_
over it." On his side M. Bigot wrote in 1714: "There are in Montreal
as many as twenty-five looms for making linen and worsted goods. The
Sisters of the Congregation have shown me the collender which they
have made for their clothing, which latter is as fine as that made in
France; there are also made here, materials of black for the clothes of
the priests, and of blue for those of the '_pensionnaires_.'"

How the ladies of Montreal were participating in the industrial
progress of the city may be seen in the letters of the minister, the
intendant and to Madame de Repentigny. In 1706 he writes to Intendant
Raudot, asking for samples of the cloth which Madame had made from
nettles and bark and which she says is better than that made from linen
and hemp. On June 30, 1707, he writes to Madame de Repentigny that he
has received the samples of cloth and the little tablets of cotton
syrup; that he has noticed with pleasure what she has told him of the
number of cloth workers in the Island of Montreal, but he finds the
price of her cloth too high.[171] He is pleased to be informed of the
sugar that is made in Montreal and of the blue earth that has been
found by the Indians thirty leagues from Montreal. Another year, he
records his pleasure at her discoveries of dye woods near Montreal and
on July 7, 1711, he writes of his satisfaction at her zeal for the
progress of the colony. On June 29th he writes that he will recommend
her son for the post of ensign and encourages her to redouble her
efforts for the increase of her manufactures.

A survey of the various _ordonnances_ issued by the intendants of this
period supplies much insight into the life of the city. During the
months of June and July, 1706, Jacques Raudot was in Montreal. The
_ordonnances_ issued by him there are of valuable historical usefulness
in providing an insight into conditions then prevailing. That dated
June 22d concerns the streets, primarily. "Having learnt," it begins,
"on arriving in this town the state of disorder in which the streets
are, being almost impracticable at all seasons not only for foot
passengers, but for carriage and cart traffic, and this on account of
the mire which is found in the said streets, and which comes not so
much from the bad nature and inequality of the land as from the filth
which the inhabitants throw there daily, and being persuaded that this
comes from not giving the streets the slope necessary for the flow of
the drainage, not being able to do anything of more utility for the
town than to remedy these disorders, and having conferred with Sieur
de Bellemont (sic), superior of the seminary, Fleury Deschambault,
lieutenant general, Raimbault, King's procurator of the department of
_Justice Royale_ of this town, we order that, hereafter, there shall
be given the following slopes." Then follow the list of streets to be
altered, directions for the remaking of the roads and footpaths, and
the sharing of the expenses, the order for the observance of the new
alignments, penalties for throwing rubbish into the streets, etc.

Then also follow penalties and confiscations for keeping pigs in the
houses, and for allowing cattle to stray in the streets. The renewal
of the prohibitions against unlicenced liquor houses is also made. It
concludes with instructions for the establishment of a market on the
_place d'Armes_ to meet the needs of the growing town. The market days
are to be on Tuesdays and Fridays, weekly. This is for the convenience
of the country vendors, who are not to sell their produce elsewhere,
in private stores, as formerly. In order to enable the inhabitants
to purchase in the market and to prevent the hotel keepers and
_cabaretiers_ from buying up everything before the citizens were astir,
Raudot enjoins, that the former shall not buy in the market before 8
o'clock in the morning under a penalty of 3 _livres_.

Another _ordonnance_ of July 2d settles the disputes amongst themselves
of the inhabitants as to the use of the commons of the island _vis à
vis_ their homes.

Another of the same date relieves the _habitants_ of Notre-Dame des
Neiges from an obnoxious clause in their concessions of land, granted
by the seigneurs, by which these would be confiscated if they sold
spirituous and intoxicating liquors to the savages. They represented
that this clause was now useless, since the prohibitions had been made
so severe by the king's _ordonnances_, they were not likely to do so,
but they might falsely be accused and thus their lands might be in
danger of confiscation. With the consent of Mr. Cailhé, (Caille), who
acted for the seigneurs, their petition was granted.

On the same day another order from Raudot straightened out the doubts
of some _habitants_ as to the meaning of clauses in their concessions,
granting the seigneurs rights of claiming lumber. It was decided on the
representation of M. Cailhé that the seigneurs would be content with
lumber rights on one _arpent_ in every location of sixty _arpents_,
never having meant to claim universal rights. They still, however,
reserved all their rights to claim from the habitations all the wood
that was necessary for their own buildings and for public works.

Again on the same day: "the Seigneurs are justified in demanding
their rents and arrears from certain _habitants_ holding concessions
from them, who had claimed that their lands were not staked out." The
seigneurs prevailed, representing that the dearth of landmarks was the
fault of the land owners, who had to provide them and had failed to
pay for them, rather than through any difficulty on the part of the
seminary.

The growth of Montreal brought new settlers who wished to set up
in business; in consequence, Jacques Raudot, in 1706, drew up an
_ordonnance_ on July 20th, limiting the number of tanners, shoemakers
and butchers. "Seeing that the town of Montreal is daily growing in the
number of inhabitants who come to establish themselves, and that the
number of every kind of trade increases in proportion, while awaiting
the pleasure of His Majesty in establishing a _corps de métier_, we
believe that it is fitting time for us to prescribe certain rules,
particularly for the tanners and shoemakers, the observation of which,
while being useful to the inhabitants, in that it will provide the
workers themselves with emulation, while giving them the means of a
livelihood, and of confining them to the special functions of their
separate trades, we ordain:

"I. That there shall only be two tanners in the town, viz., Delaunay
and Barsalot, so that they may both have work; the five butchers
who are at present in business will share in equal portions both in
number and in quality the skins of all the beasts slaughtered on their
premises unless the said tanners prefer to make an arrangement among
themselves to have the skins furnished to each by two butchers apiece
whom they shall agree upon, and the fifth butcher to furnish his share
every six months.

"II. That the said tanners shall be obliged to give the said skins all
the necessary and required dressings, so that the public may have good
merchandise, and this under penalty of 3 _livres_ for each hide not
found, on our prescribed visits, to conform to the quality demanded by
our present _ordonnance_.

"III. We forbid the said butchers to retain any skins and make French
shoes, under a penalty of 3 _livres_ for each skin retained, but we
permit them to retain some of an inferior quality to make shoes for the
savages.

"IV. We forbid them to purchase skins from those coming in from the
country, whom we order to take their goods to the market set up in this
town, where they shall be exposed for sale for tanners only.

"V. While awaiting an opportunity to make regulations, to confine each
to his allotted trade, we permit Delaunay, in consideration of the
business set up by him, to have only three _garçons_ shoemakers and one
apprentice, etc."

On the 28th of the same month Raudot ordered thirteen who had rented
lots from the seigneurs on "lower" street, either to pay their rent
or to hand them over by a certain date to the seigneurs on the
reimbursement of the expenses for the buildings thereon and other
improvements, the value of the same to be settled by experts mutually
agreed upon.

The students of mercantile economy will find that on November 11,
1707, the Intendants Raudot (père et fils), writing to the Minister
Pontchartrain, speak of the sad state of the country produced by the
low price of the beaver, but still more by the loss of 50 per cent
on the money given in France for the Canadian letter of exchange. In
1709 M. de Pontchartrain is surprised to hear that Montreal is filled
with English merchandise--a thing not to be tolerated. This was not
surprising, seeing that the Canadians were not producers, and the
purchase of all their supplies from France became very expensive. A
memoir of Raudot of July, 1708, gives an explanation that suffices. Too
much reliance had been placed on the beaver trade which had been the
pivotal point of the prosperity of the country, but it was necessarily
a precarious resource. Sooner or later, there must result either a
rarity of this product or a decrease in price. At present the colony
was suffering from the latter. Agriculture, he pointed out, should be
the principal object, but it was only an accessory. The beaver had been
the gold mine of the country. The inhabitants had sought the woods
first, preferring an adventurous and profitable life to a laborious one
on the soil. Thus they had cultivated laziness and negligence. There
was, however, a great quantity of cattle and easy food supplies, but a
great scarcity of clothing. The trade of the country turned on a sum of
600,000 _livres_ and it was with this sum that it had to settle for its
purchases in France. This is too little for a population of eighteen
to twenty thousand souls. Everyone pays in kind for the merchandise
bought in France, in such a way that money does not even come this way.
Merchandise is very dear and the _habitant_ will not work except for a
fat salary, saying that he uses up more wearing apparel in working than
he can gain by his work. The remedy for this state of affairs is, to
urge the population to the production of wheat, cattle, timber, oils,
ships, by finding a market for Canadian products. He further deprecates
the policy then in vogue of thinking too much of the trade interests of
France. He urges the minister to be wide-minded, and to realize that by
providing a wider field for the colony, the interest and prosperity of
the colony ought sooner or later increase the prosperity of the mother
country.

If France had learned this lesson of colonization, there would never
have been the loss of this country to the English a half century
later. The pupildom of New France was continued far too long by an
overstrained, narrow and jealous paternalism.

We have made these lengthy notes on the trade relations of the colony
because Montreal was the center of the beaver traffic. Indeed, as
we have seen, there were not wanting those who were opposed to
the expansion of the colony through outlying posts, but wished to
concentrate in the lower part of the colony--the same principle already
prevailing, which was to stand in the way of the growth and development
of Ontario and Upper Canada in later years under the British rule.

A memoir presented to M. de Pontchartrain in 1710 makes this position
clear, while the replies in the margin by M. de Vaudreuil, the
governor, and MM. Raudot (father and son), joint-intendants, show
the opposite view. The memoir hopes that the _congés_ or permits to
trade up-country will not be repeated; they have been the source of
all the evils, lawlessness and pernicious traffic in _eau de vie_ and
of the stagnation of agriculture, contrary to the aim of this colony,
which was to humanize and evangelize the savages. This suppression
of _congés_ would have the effect of raising the value of beaver
skins, whose present abundance cheapens the market at this time. It
would be of more avail to allow the Indians to bring their poultry to
Montreal in exchange for merchandise, for the expense of transporting
merchandise to them in the West raised the price so much that the
Indians were constrained to go to the English for their supplies. The
English did not allow their people to trade far afield. It was because
M. de La Barre had not followed a similar policy that the French had
had a war of fourteen years with the Iroquois.

The Marquis' reply was to the effect that it was the abuse of the
_congés_, too frequently granted, and not their moderate use that
was at fault. Rightly exploited and curtailed, they would favor
the conversion of the Indians, the increase of the colony and the
preservation of peace. The chief thing was to stop the liquor traffic.
As for the savages going to the English, three or four hundred leagues,
for cheaper merchandise, that was unreasonable if the goods were taken
to them. But if they were not, and the choice lay between Montreal
and Orange, then they would certainly choose the latter place because
of cheaper prices. The fourteen years' war was not a result of the
_congés_, but of M. de La Barre's action in allowing the Iroquois to
pillage the French. It is true that the English do not mingle with
the affairs of the Indians, but prefer to allow them to destroy one
another; thus they are not loved and have no influence. Our policy
is otherwise, and hence our strength. We maintain the peace of the
whole West. If Michillimackinac had been reestablished, the "sauteux"
would not have attacked the Pottawatomies, or attempted to cut the
ears of the Iroquois--a failure which may still lead us to war again.
What restrains the Iroquois from striking a blow at any of the savage
tribes is, that they know, that by our efforts they will not have the
opportunity of destroying these nations one after another, as they did
formerly, but that they will have all of them on their back, at one and
the same time.

A picture of a Sunday morning or feast day crush at the church door
after service is to be found in an _ordonnance_ of Jacques Raudot of
January 21, 1708, when on account of the disorders arising, from those
_habitants_ with carriages and those on horseback, urging their horses
to depart so quickly that they butt into one another and even into the
foot passengers, to the risk of wounds and even of life, he enjoins
under a penalty of 10 _livres_, applicable to the local parish church,
that none should put their horses into a trot or a gallop until they
are ten _arpents_ from the church. This notice was fixed at the door of
Notre Dame. It is to be hoped the _curé_ had no occasion to look for
any fines, after it had been sufficiently promulgated.

Road traveling in 1709 was no easy thing at all times, but in the
winter least of all.[172] Yet it was necessary to keep up communication
between Montreal and Quebec, so we can appreciate the wisdom of Jacques
Raudot's _ordonnance_ of December 13th of this year, enjoining all the
_habitants_ of the country in the districts north of the St. Lawrence
to cut out, each one, before his habitation, a roadway in the places
most convenient, as well as to make a roadway across the lake in the
accustomed places.[173]

In 1709 we find Raudot dealing a blow at horse breeding. In an
_ordonnance_ of June 13, 1709, being informed that the _habitants_ of
the government of Montreal are rearing too great a number of horses
to the detriment of horned and wool bearing cattle, whose pastures
are eaten by the horses and whose number was decreasing, and as the
attention of the government ought to be principally directed to their
increasing abundance, it is ordered that each inhabitant shall not have
more than two horses, or mares, and a colt, after the seeding time of
the year 1710, to give time to get rid of the superfluous ones; after
which they will be obliged to slaughter those not disposed of.

Pigs straying in the streets, in 1710, brought an _ordonnance_ from
Raudot of June 29th; they had been the cause not only of filth, but of
sanitary disorders and infection, and owners were given five days to
enclose them, otherwise the pig were to be permitted to be killed and
the proceeds to go to the poor of the Hôtel-Dieu. On the 4th of August,
Raudot enjoined on all the owners of pigs in the colony to put muzzles
on them so that those found doing damage to grain or field produce,
without their muzzles on, could be killed for recompense.

The licencing permits of Montreal were overhauled by Antoine Denis
Raudot, conjoint intendant, during his stay in Montreal in June,
1710, when by an _ordonnance_ dated June 23d, having found that
there were many selling liquors without permission of the local
government, he ordered that there should only be ten licenced
"cabaretiers-aubergistes," who shall sell all kinds of drink to the
French, but not after 9 o'clock in the evening, and never to the
Indians, under penalty of losing their licences.

In addition, he licenced nine other innkeepers, to sell _beer only_,
and then in moderation, to the Indians, three for those of the St.
Louis district, two for that of Sault-au-Récollet, two for the
Nepissingués, and two others for the Abenakis, Ottowans and other
savages, who came to the town to trade. Those with this beer licence
had to refuse liquor to the Indians after the _retraite battue_, and
never to let them take drink away with them; while they were obliged
to give lodging to the savages if they wanted to stay. This second set
of licence holders, however, had the privilege of selling any kind of
drink to the French. We can imagine that these latter outlying saloons
were in danger of being disorderly. Yet the number of illicit "houses"
increased so that in 1726 Claude Thomas Dupuy issued an _ordonnance_,
dated November 22d, which affected Montreal as well as other cities
in the regulation of the sale of liquors. By this new order, which
contained fourteen articles on the subject of innkeepers and liquor
sellers of all kinds, from the fashionable _hôtel_ of the time to the
humbler vendor of wine who had his piece of evergreen bush outside his
door--a bundle of pine sprigs, maybe, to show that drink was served
inside. Even all those who had been given licences previously by local
authorities were now to send in their titles and credentials before
receiving in return a new licence expressly signed by the intendant
himself. It was a necessary measure borne in upon him by many officers
of troops, masters and fathers of families, who complained that the
numerous cabarets were turning the youth, the soldiers and the servants
away from duty, respect and service. Hence the intendant's drastic
measure in striking at the root of the evil by putting down illicit
vendors and restricting the legitimate licences.

As an instance of the methods of the day we may cite an instruction of
the king to MM. de Vaudreuil and Bégon of June 15, 1712. "M. Bégon will
take in hand the reduction of the number of horses. The _habitants_
have only need of them to till the soil, to haul their timber and to
transport their wheat. It is not natural that the inhabitants should
make use of them during the winter to communicate with other places
instead of going on snowshoes, as they ought to do. Too great attention
cannot be paid to make the people take to this usage, now almost a lost
art, and the _habitants_ should be prevented as far as possible from
leading an easy life by these soft methods, since such diminishes their
strength and breaks down their courage."

Those interested in the first mention of immigrants of various
nationalities, settling in Montreal, will find that in 1712 two ladies,
English Catholics, Marie Silver and Esther O'Wellen, had obtained the
favor of naturalization. At the same time, June 24th, the king demands
a complete list of all English Catholics settled in Canada.

In 1714 we find mention, by Intendant Bégon, of an Irishman, "Jean La
Haye, un Irlandais" (probably John Lahy, Leahy, or Lahey, who had been
settled in the district of Lachine for twenty-two years), who had been
arrested with an Englishman, Jean Joublin, Anglais (probably a John
Jobling), for counterfeiting card money. These were probably prisoners
of war who had remained behind.

On the date of March 7, 1724, at Versailles, a brevet to practice
medicine in Montreal under the orders of Sieur Tarrazin, royal
physician of Quebec, was granted to one Timothy Silvain (Sullivan), an
Irishman by birth. On March 19, 1714, letters of naturalization were
granted to an Englishman, Claude Mathias Senif, settled at Montreal.

Engineers and others will note the reply of the king on March 22, 1714,
concerning the proposition of M. de Breslay, who had sent the king a
specimen of a marble taken from a mountain situated twenty-one leagues
from Montreal and at a league and a half from Long Sault, and who
recommended the completion of the Lachine Canal. The king replied that
the canal was not practicable by reason of the expense and the marble
did not appear excellent enough to warrant it either.

In the course of this history we have given indications of the lives
of some of the outstanding characters of Montreal whom the genius of
the place fostered. It is fitting that we should take notice of the
last days of the recluse, Jeanne LeBer, whose extraordinary career was
one of the products of the age now being treated. She died on October
3, 1714, in her fifty-third year, after having lived fifteen years as
a recluse in her parents' house and twenty more in the retreat made
by herself in the Convent of the Congregation. The manner of her life
was thus described as early as 1702 by M. Bacqueville de la Potherie
in his "Histoire de l'Amérique Septentrionale." "I can not pass by in
silence," he says, "an extraordinary trait of virtue of a young lady,
making her abode in the Community of the Sisters of the Congregation,
Miss LeBer, the only daughter of the richest merchant in Canada.
She has an apartment in which she is enclosed, having no outside
communication than that offered by a window looking out into the
chapel. Her food is brought her, through a little opening in the door
of her chamber. She sleeps on the hard floor. Her spiritual director is
M. Leguenot, an ecclesiastic of St. Sulpice, and she sees her father,
M. LeBer, only once or twice a year. In this solitude in which she has
been for eight or nine years, she has formed a new temperament so that
she could, with difficulty, now embrace any other manner of life. She
has, however, a peaceful and docile disposition: the kind of life she
lives does not consist in the abstract speculations of mental prayer,
though she employs two hours daily in its practice. All the rest of the
time she gives herself to good works of which she makes a present to
the community."

Her benefactions were very great. By a contract of October 10, 1696,
she gave the sum of 3,000 _livres_ for the maintenance of a sister to
worship day and night before the Blessed Sacrament in the Community
Chapel. On the 25th of October, 1708, she gave another foundation of
8,000 _livres_ for a daily mass, 2,000 of which was to be expended in
the upkeep of the lights and sacred vessels. She also was desirous of
adding to the convent suitable buildings for the boarding house of the
_pensionnaires_ and for the schools and of founding a number of burses
for the education of poor girls who could not afford the pension. The
foundation stone was placed on May 13, 1713, and on September 9, 1714,
she disposed of the sum of 13,000 _livres_ for the burses mentioned.
After this act she did not live more than twenty-four days, having
contracted an affection of the chest through rising during the night,
as was her wont, to worship the Blessed Sacrament. Her death was the
signal of an outburst of reverence. In the "History of the Hôtel-Dieu
of Quebec," Mother Jucherau chronicles the event thus: "Her body was
exposed for two days for the consolation and devotion of the whole of
Montreal and the neighbourhood, whence crowds came to look upon and
wonder at the holy body of this virgin. Her intercession was invoked
with confidence. Her poor tattered garments and even her straw slippers
were seized, as well as anything belonging to her, as revered relics.
Several persons, afflicted with diverse maladies, approached her coffin
and touched her with much reverence and faith, and we are assured that
they have been cured. After this great gathering her body was carried
to the door of the parish church, where a most solemn burial service
was held; the greatest marks of veneration were paid her; and M. de
Belmont, superior of the seminary, pronounced a very beautiful funeral
oration." The text chosen was from the book of Judith, Chapter XV, v.
10, "_Tu honorificentia populi nostri_." "It is thou who art the glory
of our people," indicated the degree of veneration and sanctity in
which the deceased recluse was held by the people, most of whom had
only heard of her by repute, never having seen her.

Her body was then taken to the Chapel of the Congregation and buried by
the side of her father. The following inscription was placed above her
resting place:

  CI-GIST VENERABLE SOEUR JEANNE LEBER, BIENFAITRICE DE CETTE MAISON,
  QUI,   AYANT ETE RECLUSE QUINZE ANS DANS LA MAISON DE SES PIEUX
  PARENTS, EN A PASSE VINGT DANS LA RETRAITE QU'ELLE A FAITE ICI. ELLE
  EST DECEDEE LE 3 OCTOBRE 1714, AGEE DE 52 ANS.

In 1715 there occurred a charge of murder against Jean d'Ailleboust
d'Argenteuil. The major of the town and of the government of Montreal
was then Jean Bouillet, Sieur de la Chassaigne. Acting as procureur
of the king, he demanded that d'Argenteuil should be declared guilty
of the crime and condemned to have his head cut off, and, as he was
absent, this should be done in effigy. The court martial came to the
same conclusions, the judges being Captains Le Verrier and d'Esgly,
the Count de Vaudreuil, de Beaujeu, Du Vivier and de Buisson. As M.
de Vaudreuil was a relative of the accused, the place of president was
taken by the Baron de Longueuil, who held the trial in his own house.

Bankers and numismatists will learn that in the process of withdrawing
the "card" money and putting an end to its circulation, the minister
in a letter, dated February 17, 1715, to M. de Norisbel says, that
out of 230,000 _livres_, so withdrawn by M. Bégon, the intendant,
there has thus accrued to the profit of the king a benefit of 160,000
_livres_, which private persons lose. It was precisely this kind of
impoverishment suffered by the people which eventually reconciled them
to the English rule later.

In 1717, by a decree of May 11th, the merchants of Montreal were
given the same privileges of the merchants in France of meeting in a
convenient place to transact business in an exchange or _bourse_ with
the instruction to name one of their number to make representations in
the name of all for the good of commerce to the governor general and
the intendant of New France.

Genealogical students of the origins of Montreal families will learn
from an edict of March 9, 1717, that it was decreed to maintain the
children and grandchildren of Jacques LeBer, the Montreal merchant.
This was in consequence of a request presented by his son, Jacques
LeBer de Senneville, and the children of another son, Jacques LeBer
de St. Paul. It is alleged in this report that the letters patent
of nobility were promised to Jacques LeBer by M. de Frontenac, but
that subsequently by an edict of March, 1696, it was settled that
letters of nobility should not be forthcoming except for a financial
consideration. As Jacques LeBer conformed to this condition he received
his letters of nobility in November, 1696. But by another edict of
August, 1715, all the titles of nobility accorded since 1689 for a
financial consideration, were suppressed and revoked. Hence the present
request relies on the representation of the services rendered by
Jacques LeBer and his sons during all the wars; that one of them was
slain in 1691, when he was commanding a party of eighty men, in a fight
against the English, at La Prairie de la Madeleine.

In the same year letters patent of April 20, 1717, were issued giving
permission to the Le Moynes to register at the Parliament Court of
Paris and the _Cour des Aydes_, the letters of nobility accorded
in the month of March, 1668, to Charles le Moyne de Longueuil and
en-registered at the _Chambre des Comptes_ on February 21, 1680.
This document cites the service of the founder of the family,
Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, and of his sons: Charles (baron de
Longueuil), Pierre (d'Iberville), Joseph (de Sérigny), Jean Baptiste
(de Bienville), and Antoine (de Chateauguay). There is also a notice
of Francis, son of Pierre d'Iberville. This document states, that
the founder, Charles, had eleven sons, six of whom had died in the
king's service after distinguished careers. The survivors at this date
were Charles, Baron de Longueuil, de Sérigny, de Bienville and de
Chateauguay. Of these, at this period de Bienville and de Chateauguay
were in Louisiana. Charles was in Canada and an active member of the
Montreal district, holding important appointments. De Sérigny was
probably in France, for he was then the seigneur of the Château de
Loire in Aunis. The bones of the brave d'Iberville were resting in a
cemetery of Havana.

Sportsmen may learn that partridge shooting was prohibited between
March 15th and July 15th by an _ordonnance_ of MM. de Vaudreuil and
Bégon, dated January 28, 1720. In the same year the lieutenant-general
of the jurisdiction of Montreal on May 10th forbids the merchants
and private persons to keep more than ten pounds of powder on their
premises. On May 21st an _ordonnance_ of the Intendant Bégon forbade
gunshots in the town and in the barns and other buildings in the
country places.

A similar injunction was repeated by Intendant Dupuy on March 21, 1727,
with the addition of a fine of 100 _livres_, for catching them by net
or snare, or taking their eggs.

The druggists of today will hear with satisfaction of the
recommendation by the king in a letter to MM. de Vaudreuil and Bégon,
on June 8, 1721, of a powder, and the details of its composition,
that was very much valued in sicknesses. This had just been recently
made public. It was an Alkermes or _Aurifique de Glaubec_, prepared
by Bolduc and La Serre, apothecaries to the king: it could cure the
fevers, dropsy, vertigo, apoplexy, dysentery, gravel, smallpox,
etc. English and American journals of that period contain numerous
advertisements of similar "quack" medicines.

There is an act, dated July 1, 1721, of a land sale on the Coteau St.
Louis at Montreal by the seigneurs of the seminary to M. Charles de
Ramezay de la Gesse. This was to establish a brickyard and tile works.

To 1721 we may date the first beginnings of our Canadian postal
service. In this year a posting system for the transportation of
letters and travelers was created between Montreal and Quebec and the
monopoly was rented for twenty years to M. Lanouiller on the condition
of observing a certain tariff, according to distances, imposed by the
Intendant Bégon. We may now give a picture of Montreal in 1721, as
described by Charlevoix:

"This town has a very pleasing appearance. It is well situated, well
laid out and well built. The charm of its surroundings and its streets
inspires a certain gayety, which everybody feels. It is not fortified.
A simple palisade with bastions, badly enough maintained, offers the
sole defence with a rather wretched redoubt on a little rising ground,
which serves as a boulevard and shelves down to a little square. This
is the first point which one meets on arriving from Quebec. It is not
forty years since the town was quite unprotected and exposed daily
to be burned by the savages or by the English. It was the Chevalier
de Callières who had it closed in. For some years there has been a
project afoot to surround it with walls, but it will not be an easy
task to induce the inhabitants to contribute to its expense. They are
brave, and they are not rich. There has already been found difficulty
in persuading them of the necessity of this expense since they are
strongly convinced that their valour is more than sufficient to defend
their town against any force that would dare to attack it....

"Montreal is a long square, situated on the bank of the river which,
rising insensibly, divides the whole into high and low town, without
any appreciable line of demarkation. The Hôtel-Dieu, the King's
storehouses and the place d'Armes are in the lower town; this is also
the merchants' quarter. In the upper town are the Seminary, the parish
church, the Recollects, the Jesuits, the ladies of the Congregation,
the Governor and the greater part of the officers. Beyond a little
stream which comes from the northwest and bounds the town on this
side, there are to be found some houses and the General Hospital and
on the right, above the Recollects, whose convent is at the end of the
town, or the same side, there is commencing to form a kind of suburb,
which in time will be a very beautiful district. The Jesuits have only
a small house here, but their church, which they have just finished
covering in, is large and well built. The convent of the Recollects is
much larger and its community more numerous. The seminary is in the
middle of the town. It would seem that the object has been to make
it solid and commodious rather than handsome. Its dignity, however,
is such that one is not allowed to forget that it is the Seigneurial
Manor; it communicates with the parochial church, which has more the
air of a cathedral than that at Quebec. The services are conducted with
a modesty and a dignity which inspire respect for the majesty of God,
adored there. The house of the ladies of the Congregation, although
one of the largest in the town, is too small as yet for its numerous
community. It is the mother house of the order and the novitiate of
an institute which ought to be all the dearer to New France and to
this town in particular, since it originated here and the whole colony
partakes in the advantages which so worthy an establishment brings to
it.... The Hôtel-Dieu is served by nuns, whose first members were drawn
from the Hôtel-Dieu of La Flèche in Anjou. They are poor; yet this is
seen neither in their hall, which is large and well furnished and well
supplied with beds, nor in their church, which is handsome and well
ornamented, nor in their dwelling house, which is well built, becoming
and spacious. But they are badly fed, although they are all occupied
indefatigably, whether with the instruction of children, or the care of
the sick.

"There can still be seen, from time to time, little flotillas of
Indians arriving at Montreal, but this is nothing in comparison with
the past. It is the Iroquois wars which have interrupted this great
gathering of the nations in the colony. To remedy this, storehouses
with forts have been established among the greater part of them, where
there is always a commandant and soldiers enough to place the stores in
safety. The savages always wish to have a gunsmith with them. In many
places there are missionaries among them, who would do more good, if
they were the only Frenchmen there. It would seem good to put things
again on their former basis, seeing that throughout the length and
breadth of the colony there is now peace. This would be the means of
restraining the _coureurs de bois_, whose cupidity, without speaking of
the other disorders brought about by their looseness of life, brings on
daily instances of dishonesty, which make us despicable in the eyes of
these barbarian people."

A disastrous fire having occurred on June 19, 1721, an _ordonnance_
was prepared by Intendant Bégon, who was in Montreal, to regulate the
reconstruction of the buildings. The preamble gives us an insight into
the architectural construction of the town. "On the representation
to us by Sieur de Léry, King's engineer, after the examination made
by him, it has been noticed that the greater part of the houses were
only of wood, or of framework, and roofed with carpentry, and this
has increased the spread of the fire, and that like accidents so
prejudicial to the inhabitants of the town, could be avoided to the
further good of the town, by making the streets regular, for they are
not large enough nor straight enough; that while this cannot be done
without individuals suffering, yet at the present moment, seeing that
there are only ruins in the streets, it would be easy for individuals,
before rebuilding, to conform with the alignment which shall be drawn
up by the Engineer, the following precautions should be observed...."
The employment of stone is greatly encouraged. In the living part of
the town only buildings of stone and of two stories should replace the
burned ones.

This added to the beauty of the town and we are gratified to learn that
the example of Montreal led the Intendant Claude Thomas Dupuy, on June
7, 1727, to issue an _ordonnance_ for Quebec and the other towns, to
take similar precautions against fire, adding that this would also
be a means to beautify this town (_embellir cette ville_). A further
_ordonnance_ on fire prevention was issued by Gilles Hocquart, the
intendant, when present in Montreal on July 12, 1724.

[Illustration: HOCQUART]

To the year 1722 we may attribute the beginning of work on the
fortifications of Montreal under Chaussegros de Léry. Up to that date
there had been much talk of building a worthy defence around the city,
but still the old wooden palisading was continued. The truth is that
the Montrealers ever have been sluggards in city planning; they have
never taken a forward move until forced by a crisis. "Prevention being
better than cure," never rose beyond a theory. The same tardiness has
been shown in hygienic and sanitary and general civic improvement. The
wars with the Indians had produced a brave race of Montrealers, so that
they relied rather on their personal valour than on fortifications. In
the moment of danger, the wisdom of having strong fortifications was
felt by all, but the danger passed, they became forgetful and apathetic
again. In 1693 the palisade built by de Callières was restored, and in
1709 de Longueuil had called a meeting in the Seminary Hall, "where,"
says the Engineer de Catalogue, "each one was given the liberty to
speak out his mind; as there were no troups and few inhabitants, it
was proposed to curtail the town by a fourth, by making a palisading
at St. Francis Xavier Street, cutting down the fruit gardens of the
Recollects (in the northwest) and others; but as I thought differently,
I made them see that fifty men in the mill and granary of the Seigneurs
were sufficient to defend this part and the more retrenchments and
enclosures the enemy should find to force, the more obstacles he would
find in forcing the rest of the town." Thus all things remained in the
same state as before.

[Illustration: ELEVATIONS OF FORTIFICATIONS ERECTED AT CHAUS. DE LERY.]

[Illustration: DE LERY'S PLANS OF THE FORTIFICATION]

But other counsels prevailed in 1716 when the government determined
to improve the fortifications and the Regent imposed on the town a
contribution of 6,000 _livres_, of which 2,000 had to be paid by
the Seigneurs and the rest by the religious communities and the
inhabitants, without exception. The works, however, did not begin till
1722. The new walls of rough stone, ornamented with barbicans, were
eighteen feet high, four feet thick at their base and three feet at the
top. They presented thirteen bastions, four facing the St. Lawrence,
four giving on the Little River, and the five others, which were armed
with little pieces of artillery, faced three on the north, and two on
the west. There were five gates and five posterns. The space enclosed
was about 110 _arpents_ (ninety-three acres). The fortifications were
never completely finished. As intended by de Léry they might have been
strong for he wrote to France on August 17, 1717, "I have determined
to commence an inclosure capable to resist the artillery that the
English might bring from Orange." Yet a French officer, quoted by
Sandham, in "Montreal and Its Fortifications," as present in the city
during Amherst's siege of Montreal in 1760, which was to end in the
Capitulation, writes of the results as follows: "Montreal was in no
way susceptible of a defense. It was surrounded with walls built with
design only to preserve the inhabitants from the incursions of the
Indians, little imagining at that time that it would become the theatre
of a regular war and that one day they would see formidable armies of
well disciplined troops before its walls. We were, however, all pent up
in that miserable bad place without provisions, a thousand times worse
than a position in an open field, whose pitiful walls could not resist
two hours' cannonade without being leveled to the ground, when we
would have been forced to surrender at discretion if the English had
insisted upon it."[174]

The extent of the paternal supervision of France, over what we should
consider trifles, is shown in a royal decree of June 9, 1723, on the
subject of the renting of pews in the churches, to the following
effect: that widows, remaining such, shall enjoy those pews granted to
their husbands by paying the same rent; that with regard to children,
whose father and mother are dead, their seats shall be put up for
auction, and given to the highest bidder, but they shall have the
preference, if they pay the same price as that offered by the last
bidder.

In 1723, de Vaudreuil commenced the building of his _Château_.

In 1724 the King found it necessary by a decree of May 22d to prohibit
peltry being conveyed into New England or the returning from there with
merchandise. As Montreal was evidently the recognized business point of
distribution, whence the trouble had arisen, the King ordered all who
should have permission from the Governor General or his representative
to cross the frontier, to declare at Montreal the quantity and quality
of the effects taken, making a similar declaration on their return.

Students watching the progress of the liquor traffic will not be
surprised at the skillful adroitness of illicit traders, in evading
detection. An edict of de Vaudreuil and Intendant Bégon of May 22,
1725, ordered all those who possessed birch bark canoes to make a
declaration of them to the nearest _greffe_ (record office) within
a fortnight of the publication. The object was to frustrate illicit
traders who made use of the light weight of these canoes to carry
liquor into the woods and then to hide there and thence distribute
the liquor without arousing the attention of the authorities. The
canoe was also doubtless to be watched as a means of illicit trade in
furs. No less a person than the lieutenant-general of the government
of Montreal, Sieur François Marie Bouat, was condemned in 1719, to a
month's imprisonment, and was suspended from his office, for having
sent a canoe up-country for trading purposes. The deliberations of the
court martial are dated October 18, 1719. The suspension was raised by
the King on June 2, 1720.

The year 1724 saw the death of the governor of Montreal, Claude de
Ramezay, who was succeeded by Charles LeMoyne, first Baron of Longueuil.

On October 25, 1725, the Governor General de Vaudreuil also died. He
was succeeded as administrator by the Baron of Longueuil. In 1726 the
Marquis de Beauharnois became Governor General and Thomas Claude Dupuy
Intendant, his first act being signed on December 1st of the same year.

In 1727, a special edict concerning commerce with outsiders was issued
by the King.[175] Title VI enacts that "strangers established in Our
Colonies, even naturalized, cannot be merchants, brokers or commercial
agents under any form, on a penalty of 3,000 _livres_, applicable to
the denounceand of perpetual banishment from Our Colonies. We permit
them only to make use of their lands and dwellings, and to trade only
in provisions which come from their lands. We forbid all merchants
and traders established in old said Colonies to have any clerk,
assistant, bookkeeper or other persons engaged in their business who
are strangers, although they may be naturalized...."

Clearly the modern cosmopolitan character of Montreal was not foreseen.

A decree of the Sovereign Council of February 16, 1682, had already
been made, forbidding the transportation by _habitants_ or others
of peltries to Manhattan or Orange or other places, and back, under
pain of confiscation of their peltry, money, attire, canoes and other
effects seized on their departure or return. This was promulgated at
Montreal by Sergeant Lorry about March 8th of the same year.

A letter of 1730,[176] giving a description of Indian dress, love making,
feasts, burials, fills in the picture of this period and keeps us in
touch with the Indian population of Montreal and its district.

"Would you like to learn how they dress--how they marry--how they are
buried? First you must know that several tribes go completely naked and
wear but the fig leaf. In Montreal you may meet many stately and well
proportioned savages, walking about in a state of nudity, as proud in
their bearing as if they wore good clothes. Some have on a shirt only;
others have a covering negligently thrown over one shoulder.

"Christianized Indians are differently habited. The Iroquois put the
shirt over their wearing apparel, and over the shirt another raiment
which encloses a portion of the head, which is always bare. The men
generally wear garments over their shirts; the latter, when new, is
generally very white, but is used until it gets perfectly dark and
disgustingly greasy. They sometimes shave a portion of their head, or
else they comb one-half of their hair back, the other half front. They
occasionally tie up a tuft of hair very tight on the top of the head,
so as to look like a plume on a horse's head, rising towards the skies.
At other times, some allow a long tress of hair to fall over their
face: it interferes with their eating, but that has to be put up with.
They smear their ears with a white substance or their face with blue,
vermillion, black. They are more elaborate in their war-toilet--lavish
of paint--than a coquette would be in dressing,--so that they may
conceal the paleness which fear might engender. They are profuse of
gold and silver brocade, porcelain necklaces, bracelets of beads--the
women, especially in their youth. This is their jewelry, their
diamonds, the value whereof sometimes reach 1,000 francs. The Abenakis
enclose their heads in a small cap embroidered with beads or ornamented
with brocade. They wrap their legs in leggings with a fringe three or
four inches long. Their shoes consist of socks, with plaits around the
toe, covering the foot. All this has its charm in their eyes: they are
as vain of dress as any Frenchman.

"The pagan tribe, whenever any love is felt, marry without any
ceremonial. The pair will discover whether they love one another in
silence--Indian-like. One of the caresses consists in throwing the
loved one a small pebble, or grains of Indian corn, or else some other
object which cannot hurt. The swain, on throwing the pebble, is bound
to look in the opposite direction, to make believe he did not do it.
Should the adored one return it, matters look well, else the game is up.

[Illustration: MONTREAL

1725.

PLAN DE LA VILLE DE MONTREAL EN CANADA]

"The Christianized Indians are married before the church, without
contract of marriage and without stipulations, because an Indian cannot
hold real estate and cannot bequeath to his children. The wealthiest is
the mightiest hunter. This favored individual in his village passes for
a grand match.

"Bravery and great warriors they think much of--they constitute them
their chiefs. Poverty is no disgrace at the council board, and an
orator in rags will speak out as boldly, as successfully, as if he
were decked out in gold cloth. They come thus badly habited in the
presence of the governor, indulge in long harangues and touch his hand
fearlessly. When ladies are present at these interviews, they honour
them thus--seize their hand and shake it in token of friendship. Before
I was a nun, I was present at some of these ceremonies and, having won
their good opinion, they would extend to me a hand which was disgusting
in the extreme, but which I had cheerfully to accept for fear of
offending them. They are sometimes asked to dine at the governor's
table. Unlucky are their neighbours, especially when they happen to be
ladies,--they are so filthy in their persons."[177]

Gilles Hocquart no doubt struck terror into the hearts of some of
the defaulters at Montreal on July 22, 1730, when he ordered all
the merchants and other business men without exception to repair
immediately to the Governor of Montreal to have their weights and
measures reformed, verified, sealed and marked with the _fleur de lis_.
Although there had been legislation before, still complaints had been
brought to him that there was wanting uniformity in the city on this
hand, some giving too short measure and others, strangely, too long.
Two years later, on August 9, 1732, Hocquart did the same good turn for
Quebec. In business methods Montrealers like to be pioneers and it is
to be noticed that the preamble of this _ordonnance_ Hocquart gives as
a reason for the new move, the success at Montreal, "_ainsi que nous
l'avons pratiqué pour la ville de Montréal_."

In 1731 Montreal traders sent out the Chevalier Varennes de la
Vérendrye to hunt, trade and to find the Pacific. In 1735 he built Fort
Rouge, on the site of the City of Winnipeg and in 1743 he and his sons
were the first white men to see the Rocky Mountains.

A decree of February 19, 1732, strikes a blow at the system of
religious asylum being granted to fugitives from justice. "We forbid
all curés, ecclesiastics, and secular and regular communities of
either sex, harbouring or giving asylum to all deserters, vagabonds
and persons charged with crimes, under penalty of loss of our favour,
and of the seizure of their property and of deprivation of their
privileges."

About 1736 the first sailing vessel on Lake Superior was constructed
and furnished through Montreal commercial enterprise.[178]

In a letter, dated October 22, 1730, it is mentioned that Governor
Beauharnois had that spring sent orders to the officer commanding
Chouamigon (La Plante) to make an examination of the copper mine
alleged to have been discovered in the vicinity. Nothing very
satisfactory eventuated. The Sieur Denys de la Ronde, who succeeded
as commandant, had faith, however, in the mines and had obtained a
concession to work copper mines at Lake Superior. In 1736, a son of de
la Ronde, visited an isle in search of copper. De la Ronde, the father,
in 1740, on his way to La Pointe, was taken sick at Mackinac and
returned to Montreal, but he did not despair of finding valuable copper
mines. The colonial officers, in a dispatch, wrote as to de la Ronde,
that "this officer has been ordered with his son to build at the River
Ste. Anne, a house of logs 200 feet long, with a fort and curtain,
which he assures us he has executed. He has had other expenses on
account of the mines, such as the voyage and presents for the Indians.
He has constructed, at his own expense, a bark of forty tons on Lake
Superior, and was obliged to transport the rigging and materials for
the vessel as far as Sault Ste. Marie in canoes. The post of Chouamigon
was given to him as gratuity to defray expenses. A merchant of
Montreal, named Charley St. Ange, furnished de la Ronde with goods, and
miners named Forestier were employed in prospecting."

To the date of 1742 belong the following sidelight of the methods of
execution of justice:

     "Under the title of 'The Outraged Crucifix,' in the 'Choses et
     Autres,' of M. Faucher de St. Maurice, an interesting historical
     sidelight is given of the first half of the eighteenth century,
     of a charge of sorcery, magic and sacrilege in Montreal against a
     soldier named Flavart de Beaufort, then belonging to the garrison.
     He was a "_farceur_," who had only wished to amuse himself at the
     expense of the credulity of the poor. But as the good Montrealers
     of the period did not suffer any ridicule of holy things, the
     affair had a tragic ending.

     "On August 27, 1742, the King's procurator brought him in
     guilty under the three heads of accusation,--sorcery, magic,
     and sacrilege,--and demanded that in fitting reparation Charles
     François Flavart de Beaufort should be condemned "in his shirt,
     the rope round his neck, holding between his hands a torch of
     burning wax of the weight of two pounds, bare-headed and on his
     knees, before the great door and the principal entrance of the
     parish church of this town, on the first day of the market, to
     say and to declare aloud and intelligibly, that wickedly and
     ill advised he had profaned the words of Our Lord Jesus Christ
     Crucified for the purposes of divination ... and moreover he is
     condemned to be beaten and whipped with rods, through the squares
     and public thoroughfare of this town and to be banished from the
     boundaries of this jurisdiction for three years and be held to
     keep his ban.

     "On the 30th these conclusions were ratified by the judgment
     of the court of Montreal, which further added that "Flavart de
     Beaufort should be conducted by the hangman, the 'executeur
     de haute justice,' bearing the inscription in front and
     behind--'Profaner of Holy things,'--This done, we have condemned
     him to serve as a convict in the galleys of the King for the space
     of five years.

                    "(Signed) Guiton de Monrepos."

Flavart, however, appealed against this sentence to the sovereign
council at Quebec, which but confirmed the above sentence, remitting,
however, two years from his services in the galleys. The above sentence
was carried out as a certificate bears out, dated Friday, October 5,
1742, and signed by M. Fr. Daine, councillor, and M. Porlier, greffier.

The incident left a lasting impression, for the clergy was shocked
at the sacrilege. By a _mandement_ of September 10, 1742, the
bishop, Monseigneur de Pont Briand, ordered an amende honorable
and a procession from the parish church to that of Bonsecours. Two
years later, having obtained the cross from the authorities, the
bishop instituted the feast of the Outraged Crucifix. This was to
be celebrated the first Friday in March, each year; and in 1804
Monseigneur du Plessis changed the day to the first day of October,
attaching to this a day of plenary indulgence, obtained by a papal
brief, dated March 28, 1802.

The legend of The Red Cross, illustrating further the methods of
civil punishment of this period, may be here told. Over one hundred
and fifty years ago, this part of the island, from the summit of the
mountain to the pebbly shore of the St. Lawrence, was a thickly wooded
forest. Where Dorchester Street exists today, there was then a narrow
path, beaten by the feet of the passers-by from Lachine, St. Laurent
and the environs. It bore, however, the high sounding title of: "The
King's Highway." Here and there, at irregular distances, a few farms
bordered the simple thoroughfare. At the point where today Guy Street
crosses Dorchester lived an honest farmer, Jean Favre and his wife,
Marie-Anne Bastien. Being an industrious couple, they were supposed to
have realized a good sum from the produce of their prosperous farm,
which sum, in all probability, they hoarded away in some corner of
their dwelling. In the same spot where now stand the iron gates, which
open on the avenue going up to the Convent Church, was a small house
occupied by a petty farmer, named Belisle. The demon of covetousness
had taken hold of his soul and the unfortunate man brooding constantly
over his neighbour's supposed wealth, resolved to become its possessor.

The month of May, 1752, had again decked nature in its garb of green.
The sun, his daily course over, had sunk behind the mountain and the
last echoes of the evening _Angelus_ bell had ceased to vibrate on
the air. Peace and security seemed to reign throughout the colony, as
the shades of night crept over the island, lulling its inhabitants to
slumber and to rest.

Alas! an unholy shadow lured on by the evil one, glided through the
darkness, with the tread of the panther to seize its prey, and drew
near the dwelling of Favre. Suspecting no ill, the honest man sat
quietly smoking near the hearth, from whence a brisk fire cast a mellow
light through the room, showing the table, with its two covers set for
the evening meal. Finally rising, the farmer took from his pocket a
key with which he opened a cupboard near at hand,--drew forth a small
well filled sack and added to its contents the proceeds of the day's
sale. Through the open shutter, from outside, the wretched Belisle,
with glaring eyes, watched every movement of Favre, while his hands
kept spasmodically clutching the knife he held. Wresting from his
bosom the pistol, hid therein, he burst, like a wild beast, into the
dwelling and fired at the old man, then finished him with the knife.
The wife, terrified by the unusual noise, rushed in from an adjoining
room and was at once attacked by the murderer, who plunged the knife
repeatedly into her breast, and then crushed in her skull with the blow
of a spade which he found near by. Side by side lay the unfortunate
husband and wife, victims of man's cupidity. For a moment the murderer
contemplated his work, then, like another Cain, he fled from the spot,
haunted by the dread spectre of the "_Lex talionis_."

The absence of the old couple gave rise to surmises. Search was made
and the horrible crime discovered. Suspicion rested on Belisle, who was
soon after arrested, tried and convicted. The following copy of the
"Réquisitoire du Procureur du Roi," dated 6th June, 1752, shows that
the terrible punishment of "breaking alive" was then in force under the
French régime in Canada. Belisle was condemned to "torture ordinary and
extraordinary," then to be broken alive on a scaffold erected in the
market place (the present Custom House Square) in this city.

This awful sentence was carried out to the letter, his body buried in
Guy Street,[179] and the Red Cross erected to mark the spot, as fully
described in the following document historically valuable:--

_Extract from the Requisition of the King's Attorney_

     "I require for the King that Jean Baptiste Goyer dit Belisle be
     arraigned and convicted of having wilfully and feloniously killed
     the said Jean Favre by a pistol shot and several stabs with a
     knife, and of having similarly killed the said Marie-Anne Bastien,
     wife of the said Favre, with a spade and a knife; and of having
     stolen the money that was in their house; for punishment of which
     that he be condemned to have his arms, legs, thighs and backbone
     broken at noon, he alive, on a scaffold which shall be erected for
     that purpose in the market place of this city: then, on a rack,
     his face turned towards the sky, he be left to die. The said Jean
     Baptiste Goyer dit Belisle, being previously put to the torture
     ordinary and extraordinary, his dead body shall be carried by the
     executioner to the highway which lies between the house lately
     occupied by the said accused and the house lately occupied by the
     said Jean Favre and his wife. The goods and chattels of the said
     Jean Baptiste Goyer dit Belisle confiscated to the king, or for
     the benefit of those who may have a right to them, or of those
     not liable to confiscation, the sum of 300 _livres_ fine being
     previously set apart, in case that confiscation could not be made
     for the benefit of His Majesty.

     "Done at Montreal this 6th June, 1752.

                    "(Signed) Foucher."

An _ordonnance_ with respect to the care of the foundlings of Montreal
was issued by Intendant Hocquart on March 12, 1748. It allows us to see
how the government undertook the preliminary cost of child rearing by
providing nurses for the first eighteen months; after that the children
should be "hired out" to good _habitants_ of town or country until the
age of eighteen to twenty years. Hocquart notices with surprise that
of the bastards, who survived the first eighteen months, there were
four born in 1743, six in 1744, ten in 1745, who are still being cared
for in 1748 at the expense of the King; they were to be soon "hired;"
and the Sieur Foucher, then _procureur du roi_, who seems to have been
responsible for the great delay, is informed that if the like occurs
again he will have to pay out of his own purse the expense incurred
during the long time intervening.

Students following the story of explorations from Montreal will find
that in September, 1748, a Sulpician, M. l'Abbé Picquet, began a fort
at La Présentation (Ogdensburg). He is to be found early in the summer
of 1751 with six Canadians and five Indians, beginning the circuit of
Lake Ontario. On June 26th he reached Toronto, where he found a band of
Messessagas. On June 28th he reached Niagara and on July 12th the mouth
of the Genessee, where he visited the falls.

Two of Intendant Bigot's[180] earliest _ordonnances_ are of interest
in that the first, issued on December 24, 1748, evidently in view
of the Christmas and New Year season, forbids sliding or skating on
the streets, which, "it has come to our knowledge," is practiced by
children and even grown-ups; the reason alleged being danger to the
passers by, who are not able to get out of the way quick enough;
children who are caught will be put into prison until their parents
or guardians have paid the fine of 10 _livres_. The second is leveled
against fast drivers, who are to be fined 20 _livres_ for galloping
their horses in the street. This is dated December 28th. These,
however, mostly concerned Quebec, as far as we know, but probably
similar regulations were needed at Montreal.

THE DISCOVERIES OF LA VERENDRYE

Sieur Pierre Gaultier de Varennes de la Vérendrye was born in Three
Rivers, the home of Radisson, in 1686. He was the son of René
Gaultier de Varennes and Marie Boucher, daughter of the governor
of Three Rivers, who was married as a young girl of twelve years
on September 12, 1667. At the age of fourteen he, too, determined
to be a discoverer. At eighteen he was fighting in New England, at
nineteen in Newfoundland and at twenty-three in Europe at the battle
of Malplaquet, where he was carried off the field with nine wounds.
In his twenty-ninth year he returned to Canada and was relegated to
the obscure fur posts in the north, eating his heart out till between
1728-1730 at Nepigon, a lonely post north of Michilimackinac. He heard
of a "great river flowing west." Perhaps this was the great western
sea which Russia and France both wished to secure. Accordingly he
descended to Quebec and in the winter of 1730-1731 he placed his dreams
of discovery before the Governor, the Marquis Charles de Beauharnois.
He obtained the government prestige and patronage and a monopoly of the
fur trade in the countries he might discover.

He turned to Montreal traders for the goods to trade and a company
was formed. On June 8, 1731, he left Montreal with his three sons,
Jean Pierre, François and Louis, the eldest only being eighteen years
of age, among the band of fifty adventurers, _coureurs de bois_,
voyageurs and Indian interpreters, to discover the fabled western sea
and so acquire great glory and probably wealth. He reached familiar
ground at Michilimackinac and then after seventy-eight days from
Montreal he touched Kaministiquia after a month's coasting from the
Straits of Mackinaw. As he went onward he established fur posts and
sent east cargoes of furs but not enough for his partners so that in
the winter of 1734-35 Vérendrye was back in Montreal, leaving his
party up-country. He managed to get credit and back he went with the
Jesuit Aulneau to his search. Little fur could he send to redeem his
debts. Instead he was to meet misfortune in the loss of his eldest
son, Jean, the Jesuit Aulneau, and a party of voyageurs who were
treacherously slaughtered by the Sioux on Massacre Island on the night
of June 8, 1736, five years after most of the party had left Montreal.
In September, 1738, Vérendrye entered, the first white man, the Red
River for the forks of the Assiniboine. But he found not the western
sea but the great western Canadian prairie lands. On December 3,
1738, he entered the village of the Indians. There he learned vaguely
of a people in the west who lived on the shores of water bitter for
drinking. After that his sons went on courageously for the western sea,
while he went back to Montreal for supplies and to contest the lawsuits
of his partners who had seized all his posts and properties to meet his
creditors. But his sons found only a sea of prairie, a sea of mountains
and two great rivers, the Saskatchewan and the Missouri, and reached
the foothills of the northern Rockies on New Year's Day, in 1743. At
the end of July they were back again at the Assiniboine River.

[Illustration: MASSACRE ISLAND]

Vérendrye had failed as a trader; moreover he was the object of
the jealousy of the traders who wrongfully accused him of private
speculation and who now desired to exploit the trade of the trail he
had blazed along the Assiniboine and the Missouri. The ruined man was
recalled to Quebec in 1746 and M. de Noyelles was given his command.
Governors Beauharnois and de la Galissonière were believers in his
honesty. He was decorated with the Order of the Cross of St. Louis and
given permission to continue his explorations. His constitution was
broken and on December 6, 1749, while preparing for a further quest,
he died suddenly at Montreal. But he had opened the door to the west,
leaving it to another fur trader of Montreal, Alexander Mackenzie, to
be the first to cross the Rockies and to reach, by land, on July 22,
1793, the Pacific Ocean--the western sea, the dream of Cartier, LaSalle
and Vérendrye at last come true!

CHATEAU VAUDREUIL

[Illustration: CHATEAU VAUDREUIL]

The Château de Vaudreuil was commenced in 1723, as it appears from the
following inscription, found May 15, 1806, under the foundation stone
at the southwest angle.

                           En 1723 le 15 May.
         Sept Maison appartien à Monsieur le Marquis de Vaudreuil.

The Château Vaudreuil or Hôtel de Vaudreuil occupied with its ground,
acquired in 1721, a large tract of land between St. Paul Street and
Notre-Dame and included what is now known as Jacques Cartier Square.
After the cession in 1763, on April 12th, the son of the builder, the
Marquis Pierre de Rigaud, and his lady, then living at Paris in their
hotel, Rue de Deux Boulles, sold the estate to Messire Michel Chartier,
Chevalier et Seigneur de Lothbinière, ordinarily dwelling in the
town of Quebec, Canada, but being at present in Paris. In 1771 M. de
Lothbinière sold the Château Vaudreuil to M. Joseph Fleury Deschambault
de la Gorgendière. In 1773 the latter sold it on July 26th to the
church wardens of the parish of Notre-Dame, for the establishment of a
colony. The building was opened as a school on the following October
1st under the name of Collège de St. Raphael. This was the continuation
of a college founded about 1767 in the priests' house at Longue
Pointe by a priest of St. Sulpice, J. B. Curatteau de la Blaiserie.
St. Raphael's College remained here till June 6, 1803, when it was
reduced to ashes. It was then transferred to College Street in 1804,
being rebuilt at the expense of the Seminary of St. Sulpice. In 1806,
on October 20th, it was opened under the name of the Collège ou Petit
Séminaire de Montréal.

On December 14, 1803, the Vaudreuil estate with the ruined college
and its dependencies was sold by the church wardens to two merchants,
MM. Jean Baptiste Durocher and Joseph Périnault, for a sum of 3,000
guineas. During the month of December, 1803, these divided their land
as well as that which they had bought from the seminary, as follows:

1. They have left for the public use a place named the New Market, 172
French feet in breadth on Notre-Dame Street and 175 on St. Paul Street,
without comprising St. Charles Street, which terminated this market on
the northeast and that of "La Fabrique," which terminated it at the
southwest. The said place extending in length from Notre Dame Street to
St. Paul Street, a distance of about 388 feet.

2. The rest of the land on the southwest of the market and Fabrique
Street was divided into eight holdings and sold to eight persons on
December 26th and 27th.

For a final picture of Montreal life in the closing years before the
Seven Years' War, which ended in the capitulation of the city, we may
rely on a visitor's account.

In the year 1749 Peter Kalm, a professor of economy in the University
of Aobo in Swedish Finland, and a member of the Swedish Royal Academy
of Sciences, was in Canada and visited Montreal. He had also in the
preceding years been in the English states, and he afterwards published
his "Travels into North America," containing its natural history, with
the civil, ecclesiastical and commercial state of the country, the
manners of the inhabitants and several curious and important remarks
on various subjects. This work was translated into English by John
Reinhold Forster, F. A. S., and printed in 1771, from which little
known work we quote.

On July 24th on his arrival at Montreal he was met at the gate of the
town by a great crowd of people, anxious to see the _Swedes_. "We were
assured we were the first Swedes that ever came to Montreal." He was
most courteously received by Baron de Longueuil, then vice governor,
but daily expecting his promotion from France.[181]

"The difference," he remarks, "between the manner and customs of
the French in Montreal and Canada, and those of the English in the
American Colonies, is as great as that between the manners of those two
nations in Europe. The women in general are handsome here; they are
well bred, and virtuous with an innocent and becoming freedom. They
dress out very fine on Sundays, and though on the other days they do
not take much pains with other parts of their dress, yet they are very
fond of adorning their heads, the hair of which is always curled and
powdered, and ornamented with glittering bodkins and aigrettes. Every
day but Sunday they wear a little neat jacket, and a short petticoat
which hardly reaches half the leg, and in this particular they seem to
imitate the _Indian_ women. The heels of their shoes are high, and very
narrow, and it is surprising how they walk on them.

"In their knowledge of economy, they greatly surpass the _English_
women in the plantations, who indeed have taken the liberty of throwing
all the burthen of housekeeping upon their husbands and sit in their
chairs all day with folded arms. The women in _Canada_ on the contrary
do not spare themselves, especially among the common people, where they
are always in the fields, meadows, stables, etc., and do not dislike
any work whatsoever. However, they seem rather remiss in regard to the
cleaning of the utensils and apartments; for sometimes the floors, both
in the town and country, were hardly cleaned once in six months, which
is a disagreeable sight to one who comes from amongst the Dutch and
English, where the constant scouring and scrubbing of the floors is
reckoned as important as the exercise of religion itself. To prevent
the thick dust which is thus left on the floor, from being noxious to
the health, the women wet it several times a day, which renders it more
consistent; repeating the aspersion as often as the dust is dry and
rises again. Upon the whole, however, they are not averse to the taking
a part in all the business of housekeeping; and I have with pleasure
seen the daughters of the better sort of people, and of the governor
himself, not too finely dressed, and going into kitchens and cellars,
to look that everything be done as it ought.

"The men are extremely civil and take their hats off to every person
indifferently whom they meet on the streets. It is customary to
return a visit the day after you have received one; though one should
have some scores to pay in one day." After some digressions on the
natural history of the country, he continues: "Mechanics, such as
architecture, cabinet making, turning and the like, were not as yet so
forward here as this ought to be; and the _English_ in that respect
outdo the _French_. The chief cause of this is that scarce any other
people than dismissed soldiers come to settle here, who have not had
any opportunity of learning a mechanical trade but have sometimes
accidentally and through necessity been obliged to turn to it. There
are, however, some who have a good notion of mechanics, and I saw a
person here who made very good clocks, and watches, though he had but
very little instruction."

M. Benjamin Sulte on this remarks: "A few years before the conquest
there was a Canadian named Dubois, a carpenter by trade, residing in
Montreal. I believe he was the man alluded to by Kalm. Dubois, having
been asked on several occasions to repair and regulate timepieces
belonging to people who had procured them from France, readily
perceived that he could understand their mechanism and he soon went
into that business on an extensive scale. His name became famous all
around the island and his customers increased considerably. Most of the
tools required for the art he had thus adopted were not to be obtained
in Canada, but his imaginative power was great and he made them himself
without much trouble. It is said that he even invented new models for
clocks and introduced many clever improvements, which were looked upon
in those days as really marvelous."

Another Canadian, called Champagne, also a carpenter of Montreal,
closely followed Dubois' steps. His remarkable skill often attracted
the attention of men of high class. He seems to have been gifted with
indomitable energy. One day, M. Brassier, a priest of St. Sulpice
congregation, described to him some of the beautiful clocks he had seen
while living in France (before 1745), especially those ornamented with
_carillons_ (chimes), sounding the hours and other fractions of time.
Champagne dreamed over this and finally set to work. The result was an
elaborate and astonishing mechanism, to which the whole of Montreal
paid a tribute of admiration. (See "Le Spectateur," Montreal, 16
September, 1813.) Champagne died about the year 1790.

In an entry on July 27th, Kalm alludes probably to the treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle, proclaimed on October 8, 1748: "The peace, which was
concluded between France and England, was proclaimed this day. The
soldiers were under arms, the artillery on the walls was fired off,
and some salutes were given by the small fire-arms. All night some
fireworks were exhibited and the whole town was illuminated. All the
streets were crowded with people till late at night. The governor
invited me to supper and to partake of the joy of the inhabitants.
There were present a number of officers and persons of distinction; and
the festival concluded with the greatest joy."

On July 28th Kalm went with the governor, now Charles Le Moyne, 2d
Baron de Longueuil, to a little island named Magdalene, "which is his
own property." For August 1st he remarks that the governor general,
though commonly residing in Quebec, so as to be near the ships
arriving in summer, spent the winter in Montreal. "The Governor de la
Galissonière[182] is said to like Montreal better than Quebec, and indeed
the situation of the former is by far the more agreeable one."

Kalm adds to our knowledge some notes to explain the practice at this
period of the card money already recorded as instituted by de Meulles.

"They have in Canada," he recites, "scarce any other but paper money.
I hardly ever saw any coin, except French sols, consisting of brass,
with a very small mixture of silver; they were quite thin by constant
circulation, and were valued at a sol and a half. The bills are not
printed, but written. Their origin is as follows: The French king
having found it very dangerous to send money for the pay of the
troops, and other purposes, over to Canada, on account of privateers,
shipwrecks, and other accidents; he ordered that instead of it the
intendant, or king's steward, at Quebec, or the commissary at Montreal,
is to write bills for the value of the sums which are due to the
troops, and which he distributes to each soldier. On these bills is
inscribed, that they bear the value of such or such a sum, till next
October; and they are signed by the intendant, or the commissary;
and in the interval they bear the value of money. In the month of
October, at a certain stated time, every one brings the bills in his
possession to the intendant at Quebec, or the commissary at Montreal,
who exchanges them for bills of exchange upon France, which are paid
there in lawful money, at the king's exchequer, as soon as they are
presented. If the money is not yet wanted, the bill may be kept till
next October, when it may be exchanged by one of those gentlemen, for a
bill upon France. The paper money can only be delivered in October, and
exchanged for bills upon France. They are of different values, and some
do not exceed a livre, and perhaps some are still less. Towards autumn
when the merchants' ships come in from France, the merchants endeavor
to get as many bills as they can and change them for bills upon the
French treasury. These bills are partly printed, spaces being left for
the name, sum, etc. But the first bill, or paper currency is all wrote,
and is therefore subject to be counterfeited, which has sometimes been
done, but the great punishments, which have been inflicted upon the
authors of these forged bills, and which generally are capital, have
deterred people from attempting it again; so that examples of this kind
are very scarce at present. As there is a great want of small coin
here, the buyers, or sellers, were frequently obliged to suffer a small
loss, and could pay no intermediate prices between one livre and two."

The wages given could not fail to interest this student of affairs.
"They commonly give one hundred and fifty _livres_ a year to a faithful
and diligent footman, and to a maid-servant of the same character, one
hundred _livres_. A journeyman to an artist gets three or four _livres_
a day, and a common labouring man gets thirty or forty _sols_ a day.
The scarcity of labouring people occasions the wages to be so high;
for almost everybody finds it so easy to set up as a farmer in this
uncultivated country, where he can live well, and at a small expense,
that he does not care to serve and work for others."

We have given pen pictures of Montreal at various periods. Here is
Kalm's for 1749: "Montreal is the second town in Canada, in regard to
size and wealth; but it is the first on account of its fine situation
and mild climate. Somewhat above the town, the river St. Lawrence
divides into several branches, and by that means forms several islands,
among which the Isle of Montreal is the greatest. It is ten French
miles long, and near four broad, in its broadest part. The town of
Montreal is built on the eastern side of the island, and close to one
of the most considerable branches of the river St. Lawrence; and thus
it receives a very pleasant and advantageous situation. The town has
a quadrangular form, or rather it is a rectangular parallelogram, the
long and eastern side of which extends along the great branch of the
river. On the other side it is surrounded with excellent corn-fields,
charming meadows, and delightful woods. It has got the name of Montreal
from a great mountain, about half a mile westwards of the town, and
lifting its head far above the woods. Mons. Cartier, one of the first
Frenchmen who surveyed Canada more accurately, called this mountain,
on his arrival in this island, in the year 1535, when he visited the
mountain, and the Indian town Hochelaga near it. The priests who,
according to the Roman Catholic way, would call every place in this
country after some saint or other, called Montreal, Ville Marie, but
they have not been able to make this name general, for it has always
kept its first name.

"It is pretty well fortified, and surrounded with a high and thick
wall. On the east side it has the river St. Lawrence, and on all
the other sides a deep ditch filled with water, which secures the
inhabitants against all danger from the sudden incursions of the
enemy's troops. However, it cannot long stand a regular siege, because
it requires a great garrison, on account of its extent; and because
it consists chiefly of wooden houses. Here are several churches, of
which I shall only mention that belonging to the friars of the order
of St. Sulpitius, that of the Jesuits, that of the Franciscan friars,
that belonging to the nunnery, and that of the hospital, of which the
first is, however, by far the finest, both in regard to its outward
and inward ornaments, not only in this place, but in all Canada. The
priests of the Seminary of St. Sulpitius have a fine, large house,
where they live together. The college of the Franciscan friars is
likewise spacious, and has good walls, but it is not so magnificent as
the former. The college of the Jesuits is small, but well built. To
each of these three buildings are annexed fine large gardens, for the
amusement, health and use of the communities to which they belong.

"Some of the houses in the town are built of stone, but most of them
are of timber, though very neatly built. Each of the better sort of
houses has a door towards the street, with a seat on each side of it,
for amusement and recreation in the morning and evening. The long
streets are broad and strait, and divided at right angles by the
short ones; some are paved, but most of them very uneven. The gates
of the town are numerous; on the east side of the town towards the
river are five, two great and three lesser ones; and on the other side
are likewise several. The governor general of Canada, when he is at
Montreal, resides in the castle, which the government hires for that
purpose of the family of Vaudreuil; but the governor of Montreal is
obliged to buy or hire a house in town; though I was told that the
government contributed towards paying the rents.

"In the town is a nunnery, and without its walls half a one;[183] for
though the last was quite ready, however, it had not yet been confirmed
by the pope. In the first they do not receive every girl that offers
herself; for their parents must pay about five hundred écus, or crowns,
for them. Some indeed are admitted for three hundred écus, but they are
obliged to serve those who pay more than they. No poor girls are taken
in.

"The king has erected a hospital for sick soldiers here. The sick
person there is provided with everything he wants, and the king pays
twelve _sols_ every day for his stay, attendance, etc. The surgeons
are paid by the king. When an officer is brought to this hospital, who
is fallen sick in the service of the crown, he receives victuals and
attendance gratis; but if he has got sickness in the execution of his
private concerns, and comes to be cured here, he must pay it out of his
own purse. When there is room enough in the hospital, they likewise
take in some of the sick inhabitants of the town and country. They have
the medicines, and the attendance of the surgeons, gratis, but must
pay twelve _sols_ per day for meat, etc.

"Every Friday is a market-day, when the country people come to the town
with provisions, and those who want them must supply themselves on that
day, because it is the only market-day in the whole week. On that day
likewise a number of Indians come to town, to sell their goods and buy
others."

He had some conversations with the priests of the seminary, one of
whom, Monsieur Gillion, who had a particular taste for mathematics and
astronomy, had drawn a meridian in the garden of the seminary, which
Kalm said he had examined repeatedly by the sun and stars and found
to be very exact. According to Monsieur Gillion's observation, the
latitude of Montreal is forty-five degrees and twenty-seven minutes....

He then viewed the thermometrical observations made in Montreal by
Monsieur Pontarion from the beginning of 1749. He made use of Réaumur's
thermometer, which he placed sometimes in a window half open, and
sometimes in one quite open, and accordingly it will seldom mark the
greatest degree of cold in the air. However, I shall give a short
abstract of his observations for the winter months:

"In January the greatest cold was on the 18th day of the month, when
the Réaumurian thermometer was twenty-three below the freezing point.
The least degree of cold was on the 31st of the same month, when it was
just at the freezing point, but most of the days of this month it was
from twelve to fifteen degrees below the freezing point. In February
the greatest cold was on the 19th and 25th, when the thermometer was
fourteen degrees below freezing point; and the least was on the 3rd day
of that month, when it rose eight degrees above the freezing point;
but it was generally eleven degrees below it. In March the greatest
cold was on the 3rd, when it was ten degrees below the freezing
point, and on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th it was mildest, being fifteen
degrees above it; in general it was four degrees below it. In April
the greatest degree of cold happened on the 7th, the thermometer being
five degrees below the freezing point; the 25th was the mildest day, it
being twenty-five degrees above the freezing point; but in general it
was twelve degrees above it. These are the contents chiefly of Mons.
Pontarion's observations during those months. But I found, by the
manner he made his observations, that the cold had every day been from
four to six degrees greater than he had marked it."

He had likewise marked in his journal that the ice in the River St.
Lawrence broke on the 3d of April at Montreal, and only on the 20th
day of that month at Quebec. "On the 3d of May some trees began to
flower at Montreal, and on the 12th the hoary frost was so great that
the trees were quite covered with it, as with snow. The ice in the
river close to this town is every winter above a French foot thick,
and sometimes it is two of such feet, as I was informed by all whom I
consulted on that head.

"Several of the friars here told me that the summers were remarkably
longer in Canada, since its cultivation, than they used to be before;
it begins earlier, and ends later. The winters, on the other hand, are
much shorter; but the friars were of opinion that they were as hard as
formerly, though they were not of the same duration; and likewise,
that the summer at present was no hotter than it used to be. The
coldest winds at Montreal are those from the north and northwest."

Kalm in several places speaks in praise of the efforts of the
advancement of natural history in Canada.

"Great efforts are here made for the advancement of natural history,
and there are few places in the world where such good regulations are
made for this useful purpose." He speaks of the governor's interest in
it.

On August 2d early in the morning he set out on the river with the
second major of Montreal, M. de Sermonville, for Quebec. On September
15th he returned to Montreal in the evening at 4 o'clock.

His next item of historical interest occurs on September 22d in his
journal. As it has relation to Montreal as the headquarters of the
Indian trade, it is worth reproducing.

"September the 22d. The French in Canada carry on a great trade
with the Indians; and though it was formerly the only trade of this
extensive country, yet its inhabitants were considerably enriched
by it. At present, they have besides the Indian goods, several
other articles which are exported from hence. The Indians in this
neighbourhood, who go hunting in winter like the other Indian nations,
commonly bring their furs and skins to sale in the neighbouring French
towns; however this is not sufficient. The Indians who live at a
greater distance, never come to Canada at all; and, lest they should
bring their goods to the English as the English go to them, the French
are obliged to undertake journeys, and purchase the Indian goods in the
country of the Indians. This trade is chiefly carried on at Montreal,
and a great number of young and old men every year, undertake long and
troublesome voyages for that purpose, carrying with them such goods as
they know the Indians like, and are in want of. It is not necessary
to take money on such a journey, as the Indians do not value it; and
indeed I think the French, who go on these journeys, scarce ever take a
sol or penny with them.

"I will now enumerate the chief goods which the French carry with them
for this trade, and which have a good run among the Indians.

"Muskets, powder, shot, and balls. The Europeans have taught the
Indians in their neighbourhood the use of fire-arms, and they have
laid aside their bows and arrows, which were formerly their only
arms, and make use of muskets. If the Europeans should now refuse to
supply the Indians with muskets, they would be starved to death; as
almost all their food consists of the flesh of the animals, which they
hunt; or they would be irritated to such a degree as to attack the
Europeans. The Indians have hitherto never tried to make muskets or
similar fire-arms; and their great indolence does not even allow them
to mend those muskets which they have got. They leave this entirely
to the Europeans. As the Europeans came into North America, they were
very careful not to give the Indians any fire-arms. But in the wars
between the French and English, each party gave their Indian allies
fire-arms, in order to weaken the force of the enemy. The French lay
the blame upon the Dutch settlers in Albany, saying that they began,
in 1642, to give their Indians fire-arms, and taught them the use of
them in order to weaken the French. The inhabitants of Albany, on the
contrary, assert, that the French first introduced this custom, as they
would have been too weak to resist the combined force of the Dutch
and English in the colonies. Be this as it will, it is certain that
the Indians buy muskets from the Europeans, and know at present better
how to make use of them, than some of their teachers. It is likewise
certain, that the Europeans gain considerably by their trade in muskets
and ammunition.

"Pieces of white cloth, or of a coarse uncut cloth. The Indians
constantly wear such pieces of cloth, wrapping them round their bodies.
Sometimes they hang them over their shoulders; in warm weather, they
fasten them round the middle; and in cold weather, they put them over
the head. Both their men and women wear these pieces of cloth, which
have commonly several blue or red stripes on the edge.

"Blue or red cloth. Of this the Indian women make their petticoats,
which reach only to their knees. They generally choose the blue colour.

"Shirts and shifts of linen. As soon as an Indian fellow, or one of
their women, have put on a shirt, they never wash it, or strip it off,
till it is entirely torn in pieces.

"Pieces of cloth, which they wrap round their legs instead of
stockings, like the Russians.

"Hatchets, knives, scissors, needles, and a steel to strike fire with.
These instruments are now common among the Indians. They all take these
instruments from the Europeans, and reckon the hatchets and knives much
better, than those which they formerly made of stones and bones. The
stone hatchets of the ancient Indians are very rare in Canada.

"Kettles of copper or brass, sometimes tinned in the inside. In these
the Indians now boil all their meat, and they have a very great run
with them. They formerly made use of earthen or wooden pots, into
which they poured water, or whatever else they wanted to boil. They do
not want iron boilers, because they cannot be easily carried on their
continual journeys, and would not bear such falls and knocks as their
kettles are subject to.

"Ear-rings of different sizes, commonly of brass, and sometimes of tin.
They are worn by both men and women, though the use of them is not
general.

"Vermillion. With this they paint their face, shirt, and several parts
of the body. They formerly made use of a reddish earth, which is to be
found in the country; but, as the Europeans brought them vermillion,
they thought nothing was comparable to it in colour. Many persons
have told me, that they had heard their fathers mention, that the
first Frenchmen who came over here, got a great heap of furs from the
Indians, for three times as much cinnabar as would lie on the tip of a
knife.

"Verdigrease, to paint their faces green. For the black colour, they
make use of the soot at the bottom of their kettle, and daub their
whole face with it.

"Looking glasses. The Indians are very much pleased with them, and
make use of them chiefly when they want to paint themselves. The men
constantly carry their looking glasses with them on all their journeys;
but the women do not. The men, upon the whole, are more fond of
dressing than the women.

"Burning glasses. These are excellent pieces of furniture in the
opinion of the Indians, because they serve to light the pipe without
any trouble, which an indolent Indian is very fond of.

"Tobacco is bought by the northern Indian, in whose country it will not
grow. The southern Indians always plant as much of it as they want for
their own consumption. Tobacco has a great run amongst the northern
Indians, and it has been observed that the further they live to the
northward, the more they smoke of tobacco.

"Wampum, or, as they are here called, porcelanes. They are made of a
particular kind of shells, and turned into little short cylindrical
beads, and serve the Indians for money and ornament.

"Glass beads, of a small size, and white or other colours. The Indian
women know how to fasten them in their ribbands, pouches, and clothes.

"Brass and steel wire, for several kinds of work.

"Brandy, which the Indians value above all other goods than can be
brought them; nor have they anything, though ever so dear to them,
which they would not give away for this liquor. But, on account of the
many irregularities, which are caused by the use of brandy, the sale
of it has been prohibited under severe penalties; however, they do not
always pay an implicit obedience to this order.

"These are the chief goods which the French carry to the Indians, and
they have a good run among them.

"The goods which they bring back from the Indians consist entirely in
furs. The French get them in exchange for their goods, together with
all the necessary provisions they want on the journey. The furs are of
two kinds; the best are the northern ones, and the worst sort those
from the South.

"It is inconceivable what hardships the people in Canada must undergo
on their journeys. Sometimes they must carry their goods a great way
by land; frequently they are abused by the Indians, and sometimes they
are killed by them. They often suffer hunger, thirst, heat, and cold,
and are bit by gnats, and exposed to the bites of poisonous snakes,
and other dangerous animals and insects. These destroy a great part
of the youth in Canada, and prevent the people from growing old. By
this means, however, they become such brave soldiers, and so inured
to fatigue, that none of them fear danger or hardships. Many of them
settle among the Indians far from Canada, marry Indian women, and never
come back again."

Under the same date, September 22d, he reverts to the ladies of
Montreal. Having seen those of Quebec he can now compare them. Montreal
ladies owe him a debt of gratitude.

"The ladies in Canada are generally of two kinds; some come over from
France, and the rest native; the former possess the politeness peculiar
to the French nation; the latter may be divided into those of Quebec
and Montreal. The first of these are equal to the French ladies in good
breeding, having the advantage of frequently conversing with the French
gentlemen and ladies, who come every summer with the king's ships, stay
several weeks at Quebec, but seldom go to Montreal. The ladies of this
last place are accused by the French of partaking too much of the pride
of the Indians, and of being much wanting in French good breeding. What
I have mentioned above of their dressing their heads too assiduously,
is the case with all the ladies throughout Canada. Their hair is always
curled, even when they are at home in a dirty jacket, and short, coarse
petticoat, that does not reach to the middle of their legs. On those
days when they pay or receive visits, they dress so gayly that one is
almost induced to think their parents possessed the greatest dignities
in the state. The Frenchmen, who considered things in their true
light, complained very much that a great part of the ladies in Canada
had got into the pernicious custom of taking too much care of their
dress, and squandering all their fortunes, and more, upon it instead
of sparing something fur future times. They are no less attentive to
have the newest fashions; and they laugh at each other, when they are
not dressed to each other's fancy. But what they get as new fashions,
are grown old, and laid aside in France; for the ships coming but once
every year from thence, the people in Canada consider that as the new
fashion for the whole year, which the people on board brought with
them, or which they imposed upon them as new.

"The ladies in Canada, or especially at Montreal, are very ready to
laugh at any blunders strangers make in speaking; but they are very
excusable. People laugh at what appears uncommon and ridiculous.
In Canada nobody ever hears the French language spoken by any but
Frenchmen; for strangers seldom come thither; and the Indians are
naturally too proud to learn French, but oblige the French to learn
their language. From hence it naturally follows that the nice Canada
ladies cannot hear anything uncommon without laughing at it. One of the
first questions they propose to a stranger is, whether he is married?
The next, how he likes the ladies in the country and whether he thinks
them handsomer than those of his own country? And the third, whether
he will take one home with him? There are some differences between the
ladies of Quebec and those of Montreal; those of the last place seemed
to be generally handsomer than those of the former. Their behaviour
likewise seemed to me to be somewhat too free at Quebec, and of a more
becoming modesty at Montreal.

"The ladies at Quebec, especially the unmarried ones, are not very
industrious. A girl of eighteen is reckoned very poorly off, if she
cannot enumerate at least twenty lovers. These young ladies, especially
those of a higher rank, get up at seven, and dress till nine, drinking
their coffee at the same time. When they are dressed, they place
themselves near a window that opens into the street, take up some
needlework, and sew a stitch now and then; but turn their eyes into
the street most of the time. When a young fellow comes in, whether
they are acquainted with him or not, they immediately lay aside their
work, sit down by him, and begin to chat, laugh, joke, and invent
double-entendres; and this is reckoned being very witty. In this manner
they frequently pass the whole day, leaving their mothers to do all the
business in the house.

"In Montreal, the girls are not quite so volatile, but more
industrious. They are always at their needlework, or doing some
necessary business in the house. They are likewise cheerful and
content; and nobody can say that they want either wit, or charm.
Their fault is, that they think too well of themselves. However, the
daughters of people of all ranks, without exception, go to market,
and carry home what they have bought. They rise as soon and go to bed
as late as any of the people in the house. I have been assured that,
in general, their fortunes are not considerable; which are rendered
still more scarce by the number of children, and the small revenues
in a house. The girls at Montreal are very much displeased that those
at Quebec get husbands sooner than they. The reason of this is, that
many young gentlemen who come over from France with the ships, are
captivated by the ladies at Quebec, and marry them; but as these
gentlemen seldom go up to Montreal, the girls there are not often so
happy as those of the former place."

A few economic facts noted by Kalm on this second visit are:

"Wine is almost the only liquor which people above the vulgar are used
to drink.[184] They make a kind of spruce beer of the top of the white
fir, which they drink in summer; but the use of it is not general; and
it is seldom drank by people of quality. Thus great sums go annually
out of the country for wine; as they have no vines here, of which they
could make a liquor that is fit to be drank. The common people drink
water; for it is not yet customary here to brew beer of malt; and there
are not orchards large enough to supply the people with apples for
making cider. Some of the people of rank, who possess large orchards,
sometimes, out of curiosity, get a small quantity of cider made. The
great people here, who are used from their youth to drink nothing but
wine, are greatly at a loss in time of war, when all the ships which
brought wine are intercepted by the English privateers. Towards the end
of the last war, they gave two hundred and fifty francs and even one
hundred écus, for a barrique, or hogshead of wine.

"The present price of several things, I have been told by some of the
greatest merchants here, is as follows: A middling horse costs forty
francs and upwards; a good horse is valued at an hundred francs or
more. A cow is now sold for fifty francs; but people can remember
the time when they were sold for ten écus. A sheep costs five or six
_livres_ at present; but last year, when everything was dear, it cost
eight or ten francs. A hog of one year old, and two hundred, or an
hundred and fifty pound weight, is sold at fifteen francs. M. Couagne,
the merchant, told me that he had seen a hog of four hundred weight
among the Indians. A chicken is sold for ten or twelve _sols_; and a
turkey for twenty _sols_. A minot of wheat sold for an écu last year;
but at present it costs forty _sols_. Maize is always of the same price
with wheat because here is but little of it; and it is all made use
of by those who go to trade with the Indians. A minot of oats costs
sometimes from fifteen to twenty _sols_; but of late years it has been
sold for twenty-five or thirty _sols_. Pease bear always the same price
with wheat. A pound of butter costs commonly about eight or ten _sols_;
but last year it rose up to sixteen _sols_. A dozen of eggs used to
cost but three _sols_; however, now are sold for five. They make no
cheese at Montreal; nor is there any to be had, except what is got from
abroad. A watermelon generally costs five or six _sols_; but if of a
large size, from fifteen to twenty.

"There are as yet no manufacturers established in Canada; probably
because France will not lose the advantage of selling off its own goods
here. However, both the inhabitants of Canada and the Indians are very
ill off for want of them in times of war.

"Those persons who want to be 'married must have the consent of their
parents. However, the judge may give them leave to marry, if the
parents oppose their union, without any valid reason. Likewise, if the
man be thirty years of age, and the woman twenty-six, they may marry,
without further waiting for their parents' consent."

A few social customs may conclude this chapter, as illuminative of
the times. According to M. Gaspé, the frugality of the Canadians
was exemplary. Meats only appeared on the table on feast days, or
days of great rejoicing. A vegetarian diet mostly required but milk,
eggs, fish, pea soup, a porridge of crushed Indian wheat, pancakes,
coarse bread, fruit and vegetables, did not prevent them from
enjoying vigorous health and strength. "A poor man," says Marie de
l'Incarnation, "would have eight children or more, who during the
winter go bare-headed and barefooted, with a little covering on their
backs and living only on eels and a little bread; with all that, they
are big and fat."

Simplicity ruled at table; pocket knives served the _habitants_ at
their meals, the men having homemade ones. A blacksmith manufactured
the blade, and the wooden handles made by the man were decorated with
engravings on tin. As these instruments were not supplied with a
spring, the owners had to constantly keep the blade down in position
by the pressure of their fingers. But the ingenious made the operation
easier by means of a little button placed at the part of the blade
joining the handle. The practiced _habitant_ was quite skillful
in its use, but the novice pinched his fingers horribly--a little
apprenticeship being necessary. The women made use of ordinary pocket
knives bought at the shop keeper's.[185]

The _habitants_, says M. de Baudoncourt, did not drink tea. Each one
carried his knife when invited to dinner anywhere. For breakfast in the
morning, a small crust of bread moistened in cognac sufficed.

In the Province of Quebec the ancient _dîme_ (tithe) still exists. It
consists in the twenty-sixth of all the crops. To be exempt, it is
sufficient to declare that one is not a Catholic. This _dîme_ is paid
without difficulty and is even popular. The curé himself pays it also,
in this wise: when a family has a twenty-sixth child it is taken with
great pomp to the presbytery, and the curé becomes its godfather and is
charged with its upbringing. The fecundity of the French Canadian race
is such that this method of reprisal on the curé is not rare. One of
the late ministers of state was a "twenty-sixth" child, brought up by
the curé of his parish.[186]

The children of the farming classes formerly did not eat at table with
their parents, until after their first communion. In the families of
easier circumstances, a little low table was reserved for their use;
but generally the children took their meal on a log block. There were
many of these in the kitchen, which was sometimes the only room the
_habitant_ possessed. These logs supplied the dearth of chairs and were
useful also to cut up and chop the meat upon, for the mince pies and
_patés_ for feast days. It was only necessary to turn the block over,
according to need.[187]

Travel in this period was a very difficult matter. There were few roads
and these not very passable; there were no highroads but the rivers
and lakes. We have an idea of the length of a journey from Quebec to
Montreal from the narration of Franquet, who, as king's engineer, was
visiting Canada in 1750. He left Quebec on July 24th, at 2:30 P. M.,
and did not arrive at Montreal until July 30th, at 10 A. M. But he
had stayed a day at Three Rivers, and thus the journey was only of
five days' duration! However, it was very enjoyable on the intendant's
gondola, for Bigot was always hospitable and he wined and dined the
distinguished official under the silken awnings of the cabin on his
flat _bateau_.

M. Pouchot's "Memoirs upon the Late War in North America between the
French and English, 1755-60," gives a contemporary impression of value,
which may fill up the gallery of pictures of Montreal life before the
close of the French régime.

"It appears strange," he says, "from the little care and aid given to
increase it, that this colony, which was so long very feeble and often
ready to perish with misery, for the little help it got from France,
should, notwithstanding this, have gained a population of 30,000
souls.[188] From this we may infer that the climate is fine and the soil
fertile. It is not unusual to find from grandfather to grandchildren as
many as sixty persons.

"The Canadians are very well formed. Robust, active, endure pain and
fatigue admirably, and are accustomed to long and painful journeys for
their trade, which they accomplish with great address and patience.
These voyages are usually made very deliberately, on account of the
kind of life which they lead on these occasions. They are brave, love
war, and are ardent patriots. They evince a strong attachment to their
mother country, and their little knowledge of the world renders them
volunteer braggarts and liars, being little informed upon any subject.

"There is no country where women lead a happier life than in Canada.
The men show them great attentions and spare them all the fatigues
they can. We might also add that they deserve all this, being modest,
of comely figure, vivacious in spirit and full of intrigue. It is only
through them that their husbands procure employment, which puts them at
ease and above the common lot. There prevails in the villages a tone
of good society which we could not expect in a country so remote. They
dance and demean themselves very gracefully, and this without master."

Before concluding this chapter we may here also quote Pouchot's
appreciation of the trade conditions of Canada at the end of the French
régime, since it supplements former notes on this head and helps us to
understand the position of Montreal as the center of the up-country fur
trade at the end of the French régime.

The trade of Canada, he tells us, "is made on the king's account and by
individuals. The intendant has the general direction of this business.
The king has magazines at Quebec, Montreal, St. Johns, Chambly and
Carillon, and for the posts further up at La Présentation, Niagara,
Frontenac, the fort at the Portage, at Presqu'lle, Rivière aux Boeufs
and at Fort Duquesne.

"The magazine at Quebec is a dépôt to supply that at Montreal and
also issues supplies for trade with our domiciliated Indians, the
Abenakis, and others down the river. The magazine at Montreal furnishes
merchandises to all the posts above mentioned. Its trade directly
with them was but small until the king appointed a commissary. These
magazines furnish all the provisions for the war, as well as for trade
and for the king's service. They also in part supply the artillery.

"The king has at all these places storekeepers nominated by the
intendant, to whom they report direct. The intendant has under him a
commissary of ordnance of the marine, who remains at Montreal to attend
to the details of the upper country."

The writer criticizes as unsuitable for Indians much of the merchandise
sent out, as mirrors mounted on morocco, silk stuffs and remnants
of various other fabrics, handkerchiefs, hose, and in short, all
the remnants of the shops. There was much waste for the king--much
reversion of his profits--but still it was a very profitable trade.

"The Indians gave in exchange for these goods the skins of roebucks,
stags, bears, beavers, otters, pécans, squirrels, martens, lynxes,
foxes, muskrats, wood-rats, wolves, caribous and moose. They trade
also for bread, pork, salt, prunes, molasses, all kinds of meats and
fish, bears' oil, which they value more than goose oil, and the down
of aquatic birds. All these different exchanges are reduced in value
to the beaver skin, which is commonly reckoned as a bottle of brandy
at thirty _sols_. A pound of castor is valued at four _livres_, ten
_sols_, and skins weigh from two and a half to three pounds. The price
of our goods varies with the distance of the localities."

The second kind of trade was carried by individuals.

The posts in the interior were assigned to officers in favour. They
took with them a storekeeper to trade for them. "As they had no money,
they found merchants at Quebec and Montreal who supplied, upon credit,
all the goods necessary, which they called equipping them. They agreed
upon their prices, and gave peltry to the merchants in return. They had
to earn profits for both parties. These officers had often to negotiate
for the king with the natives near the posts and to give them goods as
presents. They were paid by the intendant upon the approval and order
of the governor. This occasioned many hypothecated accounts which
turned to the most certain profit of these commandants, especially in
time of war.

"These commandants, as well as private traders, were obliged to take
out licenses from the governor, which cost from four to five hundred
_livres_, in order to be allowed to carry their goods to the post and
to charge some effects to the king's account. This feature always
presented a prominent obstacle to trade establishments of Canada, as
they were obliged to take out these licenses every time they wished
to go into the interior of the country. The most distant posts in the
Northwest were the most highly coveted, on account of the abundance and
low prices of peltries and the high price of goods.

"A third kind of trade was followed by these traders, or coureurs de
bois, who, having laden some canoes with merchandise and halving the
licenses, went to the homes of the natives outside the gates of our
posts, where they awaited the Indians in their villages, to which they
followed them, till their return from the chase, and came back
after trading with their canoes laden, at considerable profit. Those
especially who were in condition to purchase goods at first hand made a
fortune very quickly; but to do this it was necessary to determine to
lead a most miserable and painful life. These different traders, upon
their return to France, might show an amount of 2,500,000 _livres_."

NOTE

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PARISH CHURCH

The parish church, being the center of many of the activities of the
small community, deserves special mention, as its history affords
students of manners and customs interesting glimpses of the period.

The new parish church was not finished till 1678. Examination of
the records of the church will supplement the previous chapters of
"sidelights" of the spirit and practices of the time.

1675, April 15th, there is a donation to the church of a miraculous
statue of the Blessed Virgin by M. de Fancamp, with a certificate of a
miracle operated in his presence by the said image.

1678, MM. Charles Lemoyne, of Longueuil, and Jacques LeBer, merchants,
give a lamp of silver of the weight of ten marks, or about the value of
492 _livres_ of French money.

1683, June 16th, there is the blessing of a bell, given by M. l'Abbé?
Pierre Chevrier, Baron de Fancamp, January, 1683.

In 1691 there is a record on July 2d of a deliberation on the
construction of benches for the church.

1694, January 24th, there is mention of increase of wages of thirty-six
_livres_ for Tourangeau, the bedel, on condition that he will take
charge of winding the clock of the church.

1697, March 21st, this is a _mandement_ of Mgr. de St. Vallier
approving of the building of the church and inducing the Marguilliers
to undertake the construction of a tower and a choir.

In 1697 Pierre LeBer, _bourgeois_, of Montreal, touched with the
particular devotion to the Blessed Anne, mother of the Blessed Virgin,
formed the design of building, in her honour, a chapel outside the town
on the common, and having addressed himself for that purpose to M.
Dollier de Casson, superior of the seminary, he was granted an arpent
square on May 11, 1697, and the chapel was built. The place was known
as St. Anne's. The ruins of the chapel were to be seen in 1823.

1700, January 17th, the right of sepulture in the chapel of L'Enfant
Jesus, built on the right hand transept of the church, was granted to
the sisters of the Congregation.

In 1706, at a meeting on August 20th, the citizens contributed the
sum of 1,414 livres, of which 1,000 was from M. de Belmont for the
seminary, for the erection of the tower.

1708, April 19th, M. de Belmont, superior of the seminary, and M. Yves
Priat, curé, made a vow to build a chapel in honor of St. Roch. This
was apparently built at the base of the bell tower meanwhile erected.

1708, August 25th, and 1710, 1712, January 12, 1713, record foundations
for masses in perpetuity by Mlle. Jeanne LeBer, Mme. Jeanne Dumouchel,
Pierre Biron, merchant, the latter's husband, and M. François de
Belmont and M. and Mme. Pierre Biron respectively. Such donations occur
regularly in after years.

In 1713 the organist, M. Dubrisson, was given on May 1st, 100 _livres_
salary for a year.

1720, July 20th, there was a meeting on the subject of the tower again
and the construction of a _portail_, or entrance _façade_.

1720, August 4th, there is recorded a deliberation for the construction
of a belfry, capable of housing four bells, the whole in cut stone,
with "une flèche de charpentier couverte d'ardoise," and 375 _livres_
were given by the citizens to the effect.

1722, June 4th, at a meeting of the church wardens it is determined
that the belfry cannot be placed in front of the church but on the
southeast, and that one shall be made to the right of the _portail_
similar to the first one. This was approved by the citizens on June
21st.

1722, June 24th, there is a change of opinion recorded. At a meeting
of wardens and citizens it was resolved that the belfry should not
be continued on the southeast corner, but on the northwest. This
regulation was never afterwards changed.

1723, February 24th, a contract for masonry was made with one Jourdain
for the construction of a belfry.

1723, June 27th, Nicholas Bourdeau is named the second bedel in place
of the late Quenneville, first bedel, with 150 _livres_ salary; he is
to furnish besom brushes, water for the blessed waters at Easter and
Pentecost, to clear away the spider webs, to make visits every evening
around the church, to close the door well and finally to do all that
the late Quenneville did; he is to see after the payment of bench dues
under the Marguilliers, to sweep the church, to take care to close the
doors well morning and evening, to sound the "Angelus" and ring the
bells in times of thunder storms.

1725, May 1st, the benches in the rood loft are to be let for hire,
ten _livres_ for the first row, those four behind, one _livre_ less
in proportion for each until the last; moreover, ten _livres_ are
to be charged for their making. On the same day a _capot_ and vest
of Kazamet, valued at forty-five _livres_, was to be given to the
organist, Caron, each year.

1725, June 10th, the tower is commenced, but as the rain and bad
weather are damaging it and funds are low for affairs, a loan of money
is to be obtained.

1728, May 1st, a Sieur Pierre Latour, a founder, engages to make a
bell for the parish of the weight of 1,200 pounds, or thereabouts, the
"fabrique" furnishing him the materials and paying him besides 400
_livres_ in addition to his salary of fifteen _francs_ a month until
the work is finished.

1730, September 8th, the same engages to make another bell on similar
terms.

1731, January 14th, it is agreed that there shall be a canvass for the
building of St. Amable Chapel.

1734, February 14th, a chapel to St. Anne parallel to that of St.
Amable is determined, upon the ground chosen for burial purposes.

1734, March 14th, it is agreed that the Chapel of St. Anne shall extend
from the apse of the St. Joseph Chapel to the tower which serves as
a belfry, that it shall have three casements similar to those of the
tower and of the same height, a doorway below four feet long, the
window sashes glazed and fixed with iron fittings, with timber work,
covering and vault following the plan given by Sieur Anger; that it
shall have a cellar of the length and breadth of the chapel, dug eight
feet below with a stone vaulting, with an opening to pass the bodies to
be buried there, and to be whitewashed above; that the excavation shall
be transported to the "new cemetery" or the Hôtel Dieu Cemetery, as the
second burial place was sometimes called.

1739, February 15th, there shall be a chapel joining the church of this
parish on the cemetery side when the Chapel of St. Amable is built,
following the plan and arrangement made with Sieur Labrosse. December
27th, Périnault _dit_ le Marche, the organist, is given the sum of
thirty _livres_ annually.

1742, April 29th, an agreement is made with Dominique Janson de la
Palme for the windows of the church in consideration of 100 francs for
each window.

1743, June 30th, the nomination occurs of Pierre Compe, second bedel,
in place of the defunct Mongineau, chief bedel, without other salaries
and perquisites. December 27th, the sacristy is to be lengthened.

1751, May 1st, a "suisse," or head porter, shall be appointed for the
guardianship of the church.

1755, September 28th, an indication of war alarms is seen in the
authorization of M. Thomas Dufy Desaulniers to have brought over from
France the tapestry hangings for the _reposoire_ for Holy Thursday, but
if war is declared he is not to have them come.

For the year 1757 the parish church, commenced in 1672, being found too
small, a larger one was thought of and the principal citizens, in view
of building a church of 300 feet in length, agreed among themselves to
buy certain lands (afterwards bought in 1823).

It was agreed on January 30, 1757, at a meeting of the church wardens,
that a suitable place for the church would be the Place d'Armes,
and that it would be necessary to buy another place for the Place
d'Armes;[189] that opposite the Jesuit residence there were several
pieces of land belonging to private individuals, among others a plot
of about sixty feet frontage and eighty feet in depth belonging to
Mlle. Demuy. The Place d'Armes then commenced in the middle of what
was afterwards St. James Street and occupied the site on which the
Bank of Montreal and the Royal Trust buildings stand in 1914. The
war interrupted their building projects till 1823. The intervening
poverty caused by their losses and the departure of many of their rich
parishioners was a cause of the delay.

[184] There was a brewery in Montreal near the fort before the arrival

but it is to Talon's initiative that breweries on a commercial basis
and on a larger scale were started as a means of making use of the
superfluous wheat after harvest and to counteract the disorders
caused by the traffic of _eau de vie_, by making a less harmful drink
manufactured for more general consumption. In 1668 the Sovereign
Council gave the monopoly of selling beer for ten years to those who
should establish breweries, though it left the liberty of families
making their own for private consumption. [Cf. Faillon, Histoire de la

At various points in this story there has been indicated the first
beginnings of the educational system of Montreal under the French
régime. We may now present a short _résumé_ of the various systems in
vogue from 1657 to 1760. We have seen that the education began with
Marguerite Bourgeoys in a very humble way, such as was needed in a
community composed mainly of the children of labourers, mechanics and
soldiers; for there were few of the _bourgeois_ class, and less of the
gentry. Many there were of the first colonists who could not read or
write, a fact not to be wondered at, from those who came from small
provincial towns or country places in the days when the three R's
were rare. Yet they were not ignorant or unpolished, for great care
was taken in their choice. It must, also, be fairly conceded from an
examination of their signatures that a good number could read, write
and count.[190] Even their French accent was not barbarous. It seems to
have preserved a singular purity, although naturally marked with an
admixture of the patois of Normandy, and of the northern districts of
Maine and Poitou. Yet a surprising democratic uniformity seems to have
arisen in their speech which struck Talon in 1667, as it did also
subsequent serious writers such as Leclerc, Charlevoix and la Potherie.
A similar uniformity in speaking English among Canadians of diverse
national origins is noticed by those coming from England today.

Although some attempt at teaching had been made as early as 1616 at
Three Rivers by the Recollect lay brother, Pacifique Duplessis, and
at Tadoussac by Father Joseph Le Caron about the same time, the first
regular school in the colony was opened in Quebec, in 1635, by the
inhabitants, who built a schoolhouse near the fort, under the auspices
of the Jesuits, Lejeune, Lalemant and de Quen. The latter was replaced
in 1637 by Davost. We mention these since all but Lalemant later served
the Montreal Mission. In 1635 the Jesuits established their college at
Quebec for primary instruction in the first instance to young French
and Indian children. This was the origin of the "petites écoles" of
Canada. Later, Latin, grammar, mathematics, rhetoric and philosophy
were added to the college course.[191]


SCHOOL FOR GIRLS

School was not begun in Montreal till 1657, when the first
schoolmistress, Marguerite Bourgeoys, assisted by Soeur Pacaud, opened
her school in a stable given by M. de Maisonneuve. Till that date there
had been no children of school age, and Marguerite had remained four
years after her arrival in charge of the governor's domestic affairs,
waiting to fulfill the mission of teaching she had come upon. The
first school certainly was a mixed one of boys and girls. Later, the
Sulpicians taught the boys about 1661 at the earliest date. In the
autumn of 1658 she went to France to obtain other teachers, and in the
meantime handed over her work to two of the "Hospitalières de Québec"
sisters, de la Nativité and St. Paul, who came to take charge of the
hospital during the absence of Jeanne Mance, who was accompanied by
Marguerite Bourgeoys. The three new workers for the schools of Montreal
were Sisters Chatel, Crolo and Raisin. On May 21, 1669, permission was
given by Bishop Laval to the teachers to instruct children throughout
his diocese. The beginning of the Congregation of Notre Dame as a
teaching order now must be noticed. In 1670 the foundress visited
France again and obtained letters patent for her congregation from the
king, dated May, 1671, and registered at the parliament on June 24th
following. It was not till August 6, 1676, that Laval formally approved
of the congregation. On June 24th following the sisters of the mother
house accepted the rules drawn up for them by Bishop de St. Vallier
and on August 4th following the missionary sisters, established at the
Island of Orleans and of Château Richer, accepted the same community
rules.

A regulation of 1686 to the missionary sisters states that "Although
the sisters ought to teach the children gratuitously, they may,
however, take twenty _sols_ a year from them to furnish the Latin and
French books necessary, for which they shall pay each year on entrance.
The children shall furnish, also, the wood to maintain the school
fires. The origin of boarding schools may be traced to the same date,
for in consideration of their great poverty the sisters could take
_pensionnaires_ if they could find suitable accommodations which would
give them a more easy means of livelihood." Mgr. de Laval wrote in 1676
that the sisters were teaching in Montreal and other places. Faillon
interprets this as including the parishes of Champlain and Batiscan.
The house at Champlain was burned in 1676. The school of Pointe aux
Trembles was established about 1693. Lachine had its school about 1680,
the Ile d'Orleans, in 1685.

Another form of education undertaken was through the formation of the
"congregation of extern girls" beyond school age, who met on Sundays
for religious instruction. In 1686 on the occasion of a visit to
Montreal of Bishop de St. Vallier the sisters were then teaching more
than twenty older girls in domestic arts, to enable them to earn their
living in service. This may be accounted the origin of the "écoles
ménagères" or schools of domestic economy. In this same year the
governor of New France, Denonville, recommended to the minister in
France that the sisters could commence some manufactures "if you would
have the goodness to make them some subsidy."

The origin of the normal school for girls may be traced to the
novitiate which was now preparing future teachers for Montreal and the
rural districts of the province. To aid the community in their work,
Bishop de St. Vallier gave a perpetual grant on September 7, 1693, of
600 _livres_ of France, or 800 of this country, to aid the communities
to furnish teachers in the other parishes. This was followed by
additional grants. In 1691 the sisters were called by St. Vallier to
Quebec where, besides managing a house of charity, they established a
free school in the Lower Town to supplement the education given by the
Ursulines, working, however, outside the class at female occupations to
support themselves. The sisters remained in Quebec till 1659, when the
siege forced them to return to Montreal. Their convent in Lower Town
was burned and it was not till 1769 that they returned to Lower Town.


SCHOOLS FOR BOYS

The date of origin of the schools for boys in Montreal is in some
doubt. The Sulpicians came in 1657. But the Abbé Faillon in his
"Histoire de la Colonie Française au Canada" says that Marguerite
Bourgeoys taught the boys at her school till about 1666. It is almost
certain that the Abbé Souart was what he loved to sign himself,
"superior of the Seminary of Montreal, first curé of the town and
the first schoolmaster of this country," doubtless meaning Montreal
District, for already the Jesuits had been schoolmasters in Quebec
since 1635. The good abbé was superior of the seminary from 1661
to 1668, he was curé from 1657 to 1677 and the manuscript of the
seminary cited by Jacques Viger bears out that "M. Souart during his
superiority, made several foundations, among others the steps for the
commencement of the establishment of _les petites écoles_." In an
act of 1686 he is spoken of as the former curé of Notre Dame of this
town, "who formed (_a fait_) the first schools of this place." Let
him, therefore, have the credit of the first schoolmaster of Montreal
under the French régime. He was, however, assisted in the formation
of the schools by two Sulpicians, MM. Guillaume Bailly and Mathieu
Ranuyer, who arrived after some time. M. Bailly was charged with the
Mountain Mission. Six years later, in 1672, M. Rémy, a subdeacon,
came from France to teach. M. Barthélemy, a priest, also helped for
a time. M. Certin arrived in 1683, M. de la Faye in 1684, and both
taught in the school. About 1685 there was talk of a boarding school
for scholars from afar. M. Certin, who died in 1687, seems to have
been the director, urging this with M. Tronson, the superior in Paris.
In 1686 there was the first attempt at a new school commission, which
was to carry on the existing schools or others if judged convenient,
through the formation of an Association of Citizens of Ville Marie.
The associates were Mathurin Rouiller, Nicholas Barbier, Philibert
Roy, an ecclesiastical student, and Jacob Thomolet. The object was
favoured by the Sulpicians, who seemed to have desired to found schools
to be taught by others than themselves. Hence it was that in the act
of September 15th we find M. Souart giving 1,000 _livres_, and M. de
la Faye a half _arpent_ of land with a house on it (in fact, his own
schoolhouse and grounds on Notre Dame Street opposite the seminary) to
Sieur Mathurin Rouiller, a devoted and pious man of exemplary life, and
his associates, who would all seem to have acted as schoolmasters. This
association did not succeed longer than seven years, for by October 9,
1693, all the school grounds, properties and furnishings were returned
to the Gentlemen of St. Sulpice. The Abbé Chaigneau now took the
direction. M. Antoine Forget, a simple tonsured cleric, who arrived in
July, 1701, and left for France in 1715, taught during these fourteen
years. He was followed in 1716 by M. Jean Jacques Talbot, a cleric
in minor orders, who taught for about forty years. M. Jean Girard, a
simple tonsured cleric, arrived in 1724 and died here February 25,
1765. During this forty years, besides teaching he was the parish
organist and choirmaster. Besides these teachers named there were
others, either simple clerics or laymen, who furthered the work of the
director of the _petites écoles_. The schools were opened gratuitously,
but the public were invited to give voluntary subscriptions, and for
the purpose the syndic, accompanied by the clerk of justice, made a
canvass of private persons each year. If it was not successful the
seminary supplied the deficit. (Faillon, "Histoire de la Colonie
Française," Vol. III, page 265.)

Since there was no printing press in Canada, the books used in
the schoolrooms were brought over from France, such as the "Petit
Alphabet," the "Grand Alphabet;" then the Psalter and the "Pensées
Chretiennes," the "Introduction to a Devout Life;" for the more
advanced, books on pedagogy, politeness, and deciphering of manuscripts
and contracts. The last two were important branches of a finished
education in the days when printing was undeveloped. A note found in
the papers of the late Abbé Verreau tells us that in 1740 and 1742 the
gentlemen of the seminary received from France alphabets, psalters, and
offices of the Blessed Virgin and numerous copies of "L'Instruction
de la Jeunesse" and "L'Instruction Chretienne" for the girls. On the
list of 1742 for M. Talbot, schoolmaster at Montreal, there were
twelve copies "l'Ecole Paroissiale." This was a handbook on pedagogy
for teachers. While some of these may have been for the sisters of the
congregation, it was likely that others were for his assistant teachers
or the masters of branch schools for boys which were doubtless being
established in the rural parishes, following the example of Lachine,
which already had its schools before 1686. Probably there was a little
school at Contrecoeur, Boucherville, Longueuil, or Pointe aux Trembles,
served by the Sulpicians, which needed a guide book for the school, in
the curé's presbytery, taught by himself or by a pious layman. The
education was of a simple character, with religion playing a dominant
part in it.


LATIN SCHOOLS

In addition to the primary education of the _petites écoles_, there
were Latin schools. These classes were started by the Jesuits in Quebec
about 1637 and were introduced by them into Montreal about 1694, at
least after they had taken up their residence in 1692. About 1695
the Sulpicians were anxious also to undertake the work, but as the
Jesuits were already in the field, such work being in their institute,
the project of regular Latin classes was abandoned. Yet the teaching
of Latin was in time included in their courses. Gervais Lefebre, a
young man of eighteen years, entered the Seminary of Quebec in 1703,
after having made his course of humanities and a year of philosophy
with the Gentlemen of the Seminary of Montreal. The account books of
the Seminary of Quebec for 1730 show that this year six "rudiments,"
four "methods," six "Phèdre" and a dozen "Despanticière" were sent to
the Seminary of Montreal. In 1742 the latter in obtaining from France
its own books received the letters of Cicero, a dozen rudiments, six
"Imitation of Christ" in Latin. The Latin teachers in the beginning
were probably the clerics who taught the primary schools, such as M.
Léonard Chaigneau, François Vachon de Belmont, Mathieu Ranuyer, Pierre
Rémy, Antoine Forget, Jean Jacques Talbot, and Jean Girard. Later the
Latin class was intrusted to the priests, among whom were Guillaume
Chambon, Jean Claude Methevet, Mathieu Guillon, Charles de Metry
Creitte, and Jean Baptiste Curatteau.[192]

The Jesuits had been permitted by Bishop de St. Vallier to found on
August 22, 1692, a residence in Montreal. It was their ambition to
reproduce here their successful college courses started so humbly in
1635. In 1694, as we learn from two letters of the Jesuit, Père Claude
de la Chauchetière, written from Montreal, in the months of August
and September, there was an attempt to found a classical college.
Already, at least for a year, school had been kept by him for fifteen
scholars and some grown-up young officers of the troops. But funds were
scarce and he needed teachers, for he says that he himself expected
to be necessary for the missions and might be called away any time.
At this time there were only two or three Jesuits available for the
church, residence, and the care of transient Indians, as well as for
the direction of the first congregation of men erected canonically in
their church under the title of the Assumption of Our Lady.[193] Father
de la Chauchetière's letter of September 20, 1694, tells us: "I am here
like a bird on a branch, ready to fly on the first opportunity.... We
have a kind of college here which is not founded. I have some scholars
who are good _cinquiesmes_, but I have others who have beards on their
chins, to whom I teach marine and fortification, and other mathematical
subjects. One of my scholars is a pilot in the fleet going north.[194]
We are very badly housed as far as the buildings are concerned, but we
have a very good view, on an _arpent_ of land outside the town. Our
church is about half an _arpent_ distant from us. The garden is between
us and to get to the church we are exposed to the rain, the wind and
the snow, because we have no means of building. We ask our reverend
superior only for a little building of twenty feet at the end of the
church, but he has no means of helping us."

[Illustration: THE JESUITS' CONVENT]

This "kind of a college" having no funds but maintained at the expense
of the Jesuits, never rose beyond the dignity of a Latin school, with
the added splendour of teaching a few of His Majesty's pilots. For
thirty-three years, the Jesuits allowed the i that they had caressed
for a while, a college like that of Quebec, to slumber. Although the
view was good, funds were scarce and Father de la Chauchetière went
to his dear savages again. In 1727 the inhabitants, desirous of a
classical college in their town, to avoid sending their boys to Quebec
for the purpose, petitioned the governor, Beauharnois. Their preamble
shows that all the population, "military officers, law officers, the
_bourgeoise_, the merchants and the inhabitants, moved very keenly by
the ignorance and laziness of their children that had given rise to
lamentable disorders, have recourse to you to pray you, humbly and
very urgently, to second their good intentions, by procuring them the
means of maintaining youths in order, and of inspiring them with those
sentiments of submission necessary to render these children, at the
same time good servants of the king, as well as of God." The petition
then prays for the choice of the Jesuits for the purpose and for
government subsidy for the foundation. This request was well received
by Beauharnois, who transmitted it to the minister, at the same time
announcing that the Intendant Dupuy would join to the common letter,
a memorial of the Jesuits on the same subject. This the intendant did
not choose to send. Indeed, he wrote discountenancing the expenditure
on the ground that it was better to complete the courses at Quebec
before establishing another college at Montreal, thus avoiding two
imperfect foundations. He had a brilliant alternative. "Unless," he
wrote, "you should so arrange that the classes wanting at Quebec should
be supplied at Montreal, which would give the youths the opportunity
of seeing the whole of the colony and forming connections, by those
of Montreal going to Quebec to commence their course or those from
Quebec finishing at Montreal, or _vice-versa_, if the contrary was more
expedient." On May 12, 1728, Maurepas wrote to Beauharnois that the
enterprise of the college at Montreal would be too burdensome on the
king. In 1731 Beauharnois with the Intendant Hocquart again exerted his
efforts to obtain a subsidy for a classical course at Montreal under
the control of the Jesuits, but in vain. In 1736 Hocquart, seeing that
he could not get all he asked, determined to ask for less and advised
the appointment by the government of a technical master at Quebec and
Montreal to teach geometry, fortification and geography to the cadets
who were not able to follow the courses already in vogue at both
places. This failed again. Thus the college of the Jesuit residents
never rose beyond the dignity of a Latin school, or the high school of
the period.[195]


TECHNICAL EDUCATION AT MONTREAL

The beginning of technical education in Montreal must be attributed to
Jean François Charon, the founder of the _Frères Hospitaliers de St.
Joseph de la Croix_, who was born at Quebec, where he was baptized on
September 9, 1654. He was blessed with a considerable fortune for the
time, which he wished to consecrate to the relief of the sick, the weak
and orphans. As far back as 1688 it was his desire to found a hospital
for this purpose and he gathered around him among other associates
Pierre LeBer, brother of the recluse, and Jean Fredin. On October 28,
1688, he had conceded to him by Dollier de Casson, under private seal,
a piece of ground on which to found a house of charity. In 1692 the
king had by letters patent, given permission for the establishment
at Quebec and in other places where they were necessary, a general
hospital and houses of charity. Montreal was not slow in availing
themselves of this privilege. Champigny, writing to the minister in
November, 1693, says: "The establishment of a hospital at Montreal with
the king's permission, has started with the building of a very fine
house to which Sieur Charon, the principal founder, has joined two
good farms which will support eighty to one hundred persons. This will
effect all the good that can be desired, in instructing the young and
in employing them in manufactures and in teaching them trades. As they
have expressed a wish to commence next spring a brickyard near their
house, I believe that you will not disapprove of the permission given
by me to a soldier, a tiler and brickmaker to work there." The letters
patent for M. Charon's hospital, signed by the king in 1694, on the
request of Bishop St. Vallier, Frontenac and de Champigny specifically
adds to the hospital aims that of teaching trades to the young. Five
years later, in 1699, new letters patent were granted, permitting the
establishment of art manufactures and handicrafts in the house and
inclosure of the hospital brothers of Montreal. Thus it is clearly
seen that Charon laid great stress on the technical educational side
of his charitable work. He cannot, however, claim to be the pioneer
of technical education in Canada. Laval must be ever remembered in
this regard. He had solemnly opened the _petit séminaire_ at Quebec on
October 9, 1668, with thirteen scholars, seven French and six savages,
out of which he desired to find candidates for a native clergy. He
quickly found that some were not apt for study or the ecclesiastical
state and he bethought himself of establishing a second course
where the pupils might learn to earn their livelihood. A school of
"_arts et métiers_" of considerable importance for the time, grew up
simultaneously, both at the seminary and at its country branch of St.
Joachim at Cap Tourment where the bishop owned two farms and to which
boys were sent for their elementary education and to apply themselves
to those works to which they showed the greatest aptitude. In 1685 Mgr.
de St. Vallier in the absence of Mgr. Laval and with the assistance of
Denonville, had great schemes for the aggrandizement of St. Joachim as
a classical college also, but after a year's trial it came to naught.
On his return in 1688, Laval reverted to his original plan of St.
Joachim as mainly a technical school and in 1693 founded six burses
for its pupils. By 1705 it appears to have been, properly speaking,
an agricultural school or a model farm. By 1715 it became both an
elementary and a Latin school and continued as such till the end of
the French domination, whether it maintained its purpose as a school
of _arts et métiers_ not being so certain. In 1685 at St. Joachim the
"arts and métiers" were flourishing with joinery, sculpture, painting,
gilding, etc. There were tailors, shoemakers, edged-tool makers,
sawyers, tilers, etc., engaged to teach their trades to the young
students.

When Charon and his associates were planning their hospital and school,
they had St. Joachim in view as an ideal to reproduce in Montreal. They
essayed also to make it a normal school to form teachers for the rural
parishes and in this they were seconded by the intendant, Raudot, who
wrote in 1707, in their favour for government support. In passing, it
may be noted that in 1707, at least, the Charon Frères were teaching
navigation and fortification. Unfortunately at this time other matters,
concerning the _frères hospitaliers_ as a body having pretentions to be
recognized as a religious community, began to occupy the attention of
France. The minister, de Pontchartrain, ordered Raudot to publish an
ordinance as he did on December 14, 1708, enjoining the _hospitaliers_
to quit their religious uniform, the black _capot_, the silk _ceinture_
and the _rabat_ and to take no vows, those being declared null, already
made. They were to be only laymen living in a community. There was
great opposition at this time to the multiplication of religious
orders of the more severe types. On June 6, 1708, we find that the
king expressed, through the minister, his desire that the sisters of
the Congregation should not be cloistered, as he thought this would
render him less useful. He also hears that the hospitaliers of the
general hospital under M. Charon wished to take a religious uniform
and that they are wearing the rabat and taking simple vows. He desires
that this shall cease. Later, on May 10, 1710, the king still refuses
their insistent demand for recognition as a religious fraternity, on
the grounds that their letters patent were granted on the condition
that they should take no vows. In 1717 the Charon Brothers, assisted
by the Sulpicians, opened a school for boys at Pointe aux Trembles,
near Montreal. In 1718, however, the marine department came tardily
to their assistance and decided to allow a sum of 3,000 livres for
the maintenance of the public school of the hospital, and that of six
masters for the parishes of the diocese, and on July 5, 1718, announced
to Bégon that the funds for this purpose were to be taken from those
originally allotted since 1670 for the encouragement of marriages.

In 1718 and 1719 François Charon was in Paris and he then preferred a
request to the king to confirm by letters patent a normal school to be
taught by a religious community to be settled at Rochelle to train up
teachers for Canada. This community, not named, was undoubtedly the
Sons of St. John Baptiste de la Salle, or the Brothers of the Christian
Schools. Indeed the Abbé Guibert in his "Histoire de St. Jean Baptiste
de la Salle" tells us that two days after certain brothers had been
designated for this far off mission and their passage money paid, the
permission was cancelled, one of the contributing causes being that
it was learned from M. Charon, that de la Salle's brothers would be
separated throughout the parishes, an idea militating directly against
the spirit of community life. The normal school at Rochelle was not
realized. In the autumn of 1719, while bringing over six teachers from
France, on the Chameau, François Charon died on the vessel. His loss
was a great blow to his institute. His name should be ever held in
respect. Frère Turc was now nominated superior by Bishop de St. Vallier
and the Sulpicians made it possible for schools to be opened in their
parishes of Pointe aux Trembles, Boucherville, Longueuil, Batiscan and
Three Rivers.

But although Vaudreuil, the governor, and Bégon, the intendant, may
have, in 1718, looked propitiously on the needfulness of the scheme,
it was left to de Ramezay to vilify the brothers. On October 4, 1721,
the governor of Montreal wrote in exaggerated terms to the council of
the marine department that the new teachers were mostly inefficient
and incapable, neglectful of their duties to the children and to the
eleven old men in the hospital, consuming the goods of the poor instead
of being at work in the parishes as expected, that three of those
brought by M. Charon had left the community and those remaining were
as worthless. He concluded by asking that the money granted up to this
time to the Frères Charon should be given to the nuns of the Hôtel
Dieu. In spite of de Ramezay's protest the grant of 3,000 _livres_
accorded since 1718, was ratified on March 22, 1722, viz., that 375
_livres_ should be paid annually for the support of eight teachers,
two in the hospital, six in the parishes. The instruction was free
though voluntary contributions were allowable from the inhabitants to
supplement the grant. In the spring of 1723 the home government, taking
interest in the movement, gave a passage on the king's ship to twelve
men for the service of the hospital and the schools. On their arrival
they were distributed according to the orders of Brother Chretien
Turc, now superior. In spite of this apparent progress, a rumour was
prevalent in Canada that the Charon Frères were about to be suppressed
by the court. This was due to the imprudence of Brother Chretien, who,
having gone to France to renew the question of a normal school at La
Rochelle, was accused of escaping[196] his financial embarrassments
caused by the loan raised by him in the name of his community by
fleeing from his creditors to the Spanish portion of the Isle of St.
Domingo. The Charon Brothers began now to lose the confidence of the
people, although they were sustained by the bishop and the continuance
of the government grant. Even this was withdrawn in 1730 on the
alleged grounds of inefficiency in carrying out the duties for which
it was given. In 1737 a second futile attempt was made to induce the
Brothers of the Christian Schools to come to Canada. Indeed, Brothers
Denis and Pacificus came to Montreal to survey the situation. At
last, on October 19, 1745, the two remaining brothers of the moribund
institute asked to be relieved of the direction of the hospital. This
was acceded to in 1747. The last superior, Michel André, died in June
and on August 27th following, by a regulation of the bishop, the
governor and the intendant, the charge of the hospital was transferred
to Madame d'Youville, who became the foundress of the Grey Nuns, who
still continue the work to this day. The people received the change as
inevitable. The Charon Frères had outlived their usefulness. François
Charon deserves well of Montreal. He initiated a system admirably
progressive for the time. Had his followers been as self-sacrificing
and as competent as their founder, the noble work he planned would not
have fallen on evil days. None the less, their work does not meet from
some modern French historians the just appreciation it undoubtedly
received from competent authors in its early flourishing days.

[191] Harvard was founded in 1836. On October 28, 1836, the general
court of Boston voted 400 pounds sterling for the foundation of a
school destined for ministers. John Harvard arrived in 1837. He died in
1838, leaving a legacy to the school, founded two years previously, of
four to five hundred pounds sterling and his library.

[192] It was this latter, who was afterwards, under the English rule,
to be the first superior at the _Petit Séminaire_, opened officially in
1773 as the classical college of St. Raphael, the foundations of which
he had laid at his presbytery at Longue Pointe. St. Raphael's College
is continued under the name of the "College de Montreal" situated on
Sherbrooke Street, adjoining the _Grand Séminaire_, both being on the
historical site of the Mountain Mission.

[193] This still flourishes in its various branches in the parishes of
Montreal.

[194] In 1694 an expedition was being prepared for Hudson's Bay, but
the voyage being long, it was thought good to give the officers a
professor of mathematics to occupy them on their way. Father de la
Chauchetière was thought of, but eventually another Jesuit, Father de
Silvy, an excellent mathematician, was chosen.

[195] In 1773 under the British régime the Society was suppressed by
the papal brief "Dominus ac Redemptor." Gradually the members became
extinct in Canada. The last of the number in Montreal, whose death was
registered in 1791, was Father J. B. Well, celebrated for the length of
his sermons, as well as for his goodness of heart. The last Jesuit in
Quebec was Father Casot, who died in 1800. The Jesuit estates then were
annexed by the crown. It was not till 1847 that the second attempt at a
clerical college was made with success when the Jesuits rehabilitated,
as an order, after having been recalled to Canada by Bishop Ignace
Bourget of Montreal, commenced the present college of Ste. Marie on
Bleury Street, which was not ready for occupation till 1851. A school
was, however, opened in 1848 in a frame house still standing in 1914
on the southeast corner of St. Alexander and Dorchester Streets. The
Church of the Gesu on Bleury Street was not opened for service till
December 3, 1865.

[196] In justice to Chretien Turc it must be said that his object was
rather to raise funds by embarking on a mercantile project so as to
restore the fortunes of the Montreal hospital. Here he failed again,
being a man of good heart, but of no business capacity. He left an
honoured name in St. Domingo as a worker in charitable causes, but he
begged to be relieved of the financial responsibility.

It was only in 1747 that the tottering fortunes of the _Hôpital
Général_ were handed over to Madame d'Youville, but she had long
before been designated for this work by M. Louis Normant du Faradon,
who had become the superior of the seminary as the successor of M. de
Belmont, who died on May 22, 1732. This lady who now enters into the
life of Montreal deserves more than passing notice. Marie Marguerite
de Lajemmerais was born at Varennes, near the Island of Montreal, on
October 15, 1701. Her father, Christophe Dufrost de Lajemmerais, or
La Gesmerais, a Breton _gentil homme_, came to New France in 1687 and
served bravely as an ensign under de Denonville against the Iroquois,
when he risked his life a number of times and escaped being burned
alive by the savages. He was raised to the lieutenancy and under
Frontenac he became the commandant of Cataracoui. In 1701, on January
18, he married Marie Renée de Varennes, daughter of René Gauthier de
Varennes, who died governor of Three Rivers, and granddaughter of
Pierre Boucher de Boucherville. Marie Marguerite was the first of six
children left at the death of Captain La Gesmerais, in 1708, in poor
circumstances. The widow was married to an Irish gentleman of the name
of Timothée de Silvain (or Sullivan), who had received his letters of
naturalization and an honorary brevet as king's physician in 1724. He
accordingly practiced medicine in Montreal to the satisfaction of the
seminary and the general public and with the favour of his patron, M.
de Vaudreuil. But on the latter's death the other doctors of Canada
disputed his right to practice, but unsuccessfully. M. de Silvain as a
good Irishman got into trouble with the Sieur de Monrepos, the justice
of Montreal, 1744, and a warrant for his arrest was issued. But owing
to the mediation of his brother-in-law, captain of the guard, M. de
Varennes, he escaped. But de Varennes was permanently deprived of his
command in consequence. Whatever his qualities as a medical man, Madame
de Vaudreuil, writing to the minister of marine in 1777, in favor of a
cadetship for the youngest of his stepsons, states that M. de Silvain
had been a true father and had spared no efforts to give the children
an education.

On August 12, 1722, Marie Marguerite de Lajemmerais married, in the
parish church, a gentleman of Montreal, M. François Madeleine You
d'Youville. It was an unhappy marriage, ending in great poverty through
the dissipation and extravagance of the husband who died unexpectedly
on July 4, 1730, after eight years of married life, leaving
considerable debts, and two boys. Three other children had already
died and a fourth died a little after its birth, on July 16, 1730. The
widow d'Youville in her grief, without neglecting the education of her
children, found consolation in devoting herself to the poor, especially
of the hospital of the Charon Frères. In addition she gave proof of
executive ability as a member of the ladies of the confraternity of
the Holy Family, as treasurer, assistant and superior. Such qualities
pointed her out to M. Lescöat, her Sulpician director, and to M.
Normant, who succeeded him, as the one who could save the utter decay
of the hospital. In 1737 Madame d'Youville associated with herself
in her charitable work for the poor a virtuous girl, Louise Thaumur
Lasource, a daughter of a physician of the town, to whom were added on
December 31st two others, Mademoiselle Demers and Mademoiselle Cusson.
These finally on October 30, 1738, having rented a house, undertook
the care of four or five poor persons, whose numbers soon rose to six.
This move met opposition in certain quarters since it was shrewdly
guessed that it was the intention of the seigneurs of the seminary,
the directors of the new formation, to prepare this band of women to
succeed to the care of the hospital. On All Saints' Day, November
1st, as they were leaving their new home, the women were subjected to
insults and stone throwing. The foul calumny was quickly insinuated
that they supported themselves by selling intoxicating liquors to the
savages and were not above indulging in them themselves. Hence they
called them the _Soeurs Grises_, the word, _grises_, besides meaning
grey, also conveying the approbrious suggestion of drunkenness. In
France the name "Soeurs Grises" was given to the devoted daughters of
Saint Vincent de Paul, whose grey habits were familiar among the poor
and wretched. It was an honoured name. But in Montreal the wits used
it in another sense. Time has since had its revenge. The hubbub was so
great that one of the Recollect Fathers publicly refused holy communion
to Madame d'Youville and her companions. A petition signed by M.
Boisberthelot de Beaucourt, the governor of Montreal, by eight officers
of the troops and twenty others, was sent to M. Maurepas, minister of
marine, protesting the action being taken by M. Normant in preparing to
seize the house for the Soeurs Grises as soon as the hospital should
cease. They prayed the minister to engage the Brothers of the Christian
Schools to incorporate the remaining Hospital Brothers into their
institute and thus perpetuate the institution, now ready to close for
want of subjects.

The sons of de la Salle could not accept Canada, as we have seen.
Unless the Sulpicians trained up Madame d'Youville's devoted band,
none others were forthcoming to continue the hospital and it must
inevitably close. And as to the seminary seizing on the property of the
Charon Frères, this was but rightful, as M. Tronson, the superior of
the Seminary of St. Sulpice at Paris, in the original donation of the
vast amount of ground for their institution had stipulated that if
the hospital should cease, the lands and the buildings thereon should
revert to the seigneurs, unless the brothers should prefer to reimburse
the price of the land. This had now become impossible.

Meanwhile the four ladies pursued their course, providing the means of
sustenance for themselves and their poor by their own needlework till
death struck down Mademoiselle Cusson on February 20, 1741. To add to
her afflictions Madame d'Youville was afflicted with a knee trouble
for six or seven years, which kept her inactive to her chair. Hardly
had she recovered when on the last day of January, 1745, an hour after
midnight, the house was burned down to the delight of her enemies,
who according to her biographer, M. Sattin, exclaimed: "You see that
violet flame? It is caused by the burning of the _eau de vie_ kept
for the savages." The fire drew the sisterhood nearer to one another
and on February 2d, by an act passed before M. Normant, they put all
their goods in common and drew up a religious rule of life. A house was
offered them by a rich trader, M. Fontblanche, but this the governor,
M. de Beaucourt, seized on as more suitable for himself. A charitable
Madame Lacorne offered her house, but this was shortly afterwards
relinquished for a more commodious one near the parish church to house
the three ladies and their nine poor dependants. Meanwhile, things
were going from bad to worse at the _Hôpital Général_, so that at last
the administrators of the hospital by letters of August 27, 1747,
handed over the provisional control to Madame d'Youville, one of the
conditions being that the two remaining hospital brothers should be
cared for. This happened under the governor general, the Marquis de
Beauharnois, and Intendant Hocquart. The work of making the sadly
needed repairs to the dilapidated buildings occupied September and on
October 7th Madame d'Youville and her companions took up residence.
These latter were _Mlles_, Thaumur, Demers, Rainville, Laforme,
Verroneau and _Mlle._ Despuis, who remained nine years as a boarder.
The hospital now began to realize its title of _général_, for none
but four old men were found there. Soon the number of sick and weak
began to increase of either sex without exception of age or condition
and the aims of its original charter were being realized. An early
side development was the establishment in the top part of the building
of a refuge for fallen women, which the soldiers of the town called
"Jericho." But changes in government were occurring. M. de Beauharnois
was replaced by M. de La Galissonière while awaiting the release of M.
de la Jonquière, detained a prisoner in England. The Intendant Hocquart
was replaced by M. Bigot.

[Illustration: CHARLES DE BEAUHARNOIS]

[Illustration: COMTE ROLAND-MICHEL BARRIN DE LA GALISSONNIERE]

New schemes were soon on foot, one of which was to unite the General
Hospital to the Hôtel Dieu of Quebec or of Montreal, or to General
Hospital of Quebec, which latter was approved of by M. de la Jonquière,
recently arrived in the colony, and M. Bigot, in a letter to the
minister on October 1, 1749. The object was to lessen expenses by
curtailing the number of public institutions. But its justice did
not appeal to the Montrealers, who were asked to transfer their aged
and sick to Quebec, when the _Hôpital Général_ had been founded by
Montreal charity for the infirm of their own town. Accordingly, Madame
d'Youville and her companions, backed up by M. Normant, petitioned
the governor general, the intendant and the bishop, but with little
success, owing to the predilection of M. Bigot for the general hospital
at Quebec.

On November 23, 1750, an ordinance secretly prepared at Quebec on
October 15th, was suddenly proclaimed in Montreal announcing by the
sound of the drum that the transfer of the hospital to Quebec was to
take place and that the nuns of Quebec could at once sell all the
buildings, together with furniture, not easily removable to Quebec,
and that those who were opposed to the sale could make their protests
to M. Bigot with three months! A curious derangement of the usual
practice. It is related that Madame d'Youville was out marketing for
her poor when she heard the announcement, for the first time, of her
downfall. The people, who by this had changed in their opinions toward
the "Soeur Grises" murmured long and loud against this injustice to
Montreal in favour of Quebec. A petition was drawn up by M. Normant
addressed to the minister and a copy was made to be sent by way of a
request to the bishop, the governor general and the intendant, both
being signed by the ecclesiastics of the seminary and by more than
eighty notables of the town, as the head of whom were the governor,
then M. de Longueuil, the lieutenant of the king, the town major, the
officers and the magistrates. This petition showed that the union of
the hospitals of Montreal and Quebec was null, being contrary to the
express word of Louis XIV, given to the citizens in 1692, two years
before the foundation of this establishment, namely, that the hospital
should subsist in perpetuity at Montreal without being able to change
its place or the nature of its pious work, and concluded that as the
private charity of many had founded this hospital the ordinance of
October 15th could not be legitimate. This petition Madame d'Youville
took to Quebec. But while being kindly received by the governor she
received scant courtesy from M. Bigot. Meanwhile the case had gone to
France, the Quebec religious had begun to take legal possession of
the hospital lands and to remove the furniture to Quebec, and July,
the time for the evacuation of the hospital by Madame d'Youville, was
approaching. At last M. Bigot received the letter of July 2, 1751, of
the minister to the governor general and the intendant, ordering the
suspension of the execution of the ordinance of October 15, 1750.

Finally on June 3, 1753, letters patent were signed by the king
at Versailles, handing over the privileges granted in 1694 to
Madame d'Youville and her companions to the number of twelve
_administratrices_. The community received their habit, which was
approved by a mandement, of Mgr. de Pontbriant on June 15, 1755. The
sisters chose the grey costume, now so familiar, and which was then
known in France as "_café au lait_." They wished to preserve the name
of "Grey Sisters" or _Soeur Grises_ given them first in derision. They
received their formal investiture of their habits on August 25th at
the hands of their patron, M. Normant. Their formal name was, however,
"Sisters of Charity."

The long peace during which Montreal had made great progress was at
last to end. The Seven Years' War began formally in 1750, when France,
Austria and Russia entered the lists against England and Prussia, and
ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. We are now to study the history
of Montreal in the period during which the final struggle for the
mastery between the English and the French powers was being fiercely
maintained. Montreal played a peculiar part as the headquarters of
military operations, to be directed for defence and offence, by way
of Lake Champlain, against the heart of the British settlements. This
was the most natural point of attack, as the other two routes for the
invasion of Canada offered little encouragement--the lower St. Lawrence
on the east being guarded by the natural and almost impregnable
fortress of Quebec, the upper St. Lawrence on the west being protected
by a long chain of dangerous rapids. If we delay on the events of
1756-60, it is because this was the crucial and pivotal point of
Canadian history and Montreal was for the most part the headquarters of
de Vaudreuil and Montcalm, who directed the military operations thence.
Before entering on these fateful years, let us review the situation.

The treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was concluded on October 8, 1748. By it
an official and fictitious peace ruled between England and France, but
in the colonies the rival powers were still disputing the possession
of territories and influence, whether in India or in America. In
the latter country there were frequent skirmishes on the frontiers
of Acadia. In the summer of 1749 Galissonière, the hump-backed but
high-minded administrator general, sent out to vindicate French rights
in the valley of Ohio, Céleron de Bienville, one of the Le Moynes, a
chevalier of St. Louis and a captain in the colonial troops. Leaving
Lachine on June 15th, he took with him twenty-three birchwood canoes,
with fourteen officers and cadets, twenty soldiers, a hundred and
eighty Canadians and a band of Indians, to the district of the Ohio and
the Alleghenies, where he buried six leaden plates at various places,
to mark French occupation.

The same policy of vindication was followed under the Sieur de la
Jonquière, made governor, on August 16th of the same year, and the
Marquis du Quesne, succeeding him August 7, 1752. This activity
provoked the recriminations of Virginia and the other colonies west
of the Alleghenies, the treacherous slaying of the young Coulon de
Jumonville and nine of his band, on May 28, 1754, being one of the
events which woke up Canada and France to the farcical make-believe of
peace between the two nations. England was ready to declare war, but
France, weakened after the Austrian Succession, impoverished in her
finances, with a decadent marine service, immersed in religious and
parliamentary troubles, and its people loaded with taxes, sought to
temporize and to stave off the inevitable crisis.

In the month of January, 1755, the English government provoked the
French to defend Canada, by sending Major General Braddock, with two
regiments, to command the regular and colonial troops. Accordingly on
May 3, 1755, a squadron of fourteen ships sailed from Brest, bearing
about three thousand soldiers for America, under the command of Admiral
Dubois de la Motte. With the fleet were M. de Vaudreuil, son of the
former Governor of Montreal, himself now governor general elect, his
appointment being dated from July 1Oth, and the Baron de Dieskau,
commissioned as commandant of the troops which were sent out. Their
journey was interrupted by the English pirates, who captured the
_Alcide_ and the _Lis_, making prisoners of M. Rigaud de Vaudreuil,
brother of the governor general, and himself the Governor of Three
Rivers, several officers and eight companies. Similar acts of piracy,
directly countenanced by the English government, were being committed
on the seas, and they provoked lively indignation in France. But,
although the Marquis de Mirepoix, the French ambassador at the Court
of St. James in London, was recalled and shots were being interchanged
in America, so that Baron de Dieskau was wounded and taken prisoner at
Lake George by General William Johnson, yet conflicting views in France
between the parties led by the Count d'Argenson, minister of war, and
M. de Machault, minister of marine, delayed any decision that year.

In January, 1756, however, it became necessary to look around in
France for a successor to Dieskau and to prepare a new body of troops
for Canada, to be sent that spring. D'Argenson's choice fell upon the
Marquis Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, then at Montpellier, a soldier of
forty-four years of age, who had seen many campaigns. Montcalm lost
no time in arranging his staff and household retinue. Since these
are to figure in the life of Montreal of their period, we give their
names. His first _aide-de-camp_ was Louis Antoine de Bougainville,
of whom Montcalm wrote in his journal: "He is a young man of light,
and literary ability, a great geometrician, known for his work on the
integral calculus; he belongs to the Royal Society of London, and
aspires to the Academy of Sciences in Paris, where he could have had
a place, had he not preferred to go to America to learn the trade of
war and to give proofs of his good will." He was highly recommended to
the new maréchal de camp, a dignity equivalent to that of a general of
brigade. Bougainville was named, before leaving, _Capitaine réformé_.
The second _aide_ was M. de la Rochebeaucour, "a gentleman of good
birth from Poitou, a lieutenant in Montcalm's cavalry," The third,
a working _aide-de-camp_, acting as secretary, was an under-officer
of the Flanders Regiment, named Marcel, a sergeant, who now became
lieutenant réformé.

Among his household attendants he included "a cook and his assistant,
a demi _valet-de-chambre_, Grison, Joseph, Dejean, as first lacqueys,
and two other men in livery." "I am going away in great style, with the
young surgeons whom the king is sending."

His military staff appointed by the king included, as brigadier,
François Gaston, Chevalier de Lévis, cousin of the Marquis de Mirepoix,
recently the French ambassador in London but now named lieutenant
general of Languedoc, and M. de Bourlamaque as colonel. The Chevalier
de Lévis was in his thirty-seventh year, being born in 1719; he had
served in one of the regiments of the marine department in the campaign
in Bohemia in 1741-42; he was at the battle of Dettingen and took an
active part in the campaigns on the Rhine from 1743 to 1756. This
gallant soldier, already distinguished for his bravery and military
qualities, has left his name in Canadian history. Colonel Bourlamaque
had been captain and staff adjutant in the Dauphin Regiment. With
Montcalm's staff there were also two engineers, des Combles and
Desandrouins.

At Brest, the point of departure, the two battalions of the La Sarre
and Royal-Roussillon, each composed of thirteen companies, were ready
to depart, when Montcalm arrived on March 21st, and met the _personnel_
of his staff. By the 26th the battalions were all embarked on three
vessels. Montcalm and Bougainville were on the _Licorne_, commanded by
M. de la Rigaudière, and with Captain Pelegrin, of whom Montcalm wrote
to his family before departing that "he could sail the Saint Lawrence
with his eyes shut," The rest were distributed on the other vessels,
the _Sauvage_ and the _Sirène_. But the _Licorne_ was prevented from
leaving the roadstead till April 3d.

At last, after a stormy voyage, the _Licorne_ reached Quebec on May
13th, a few hours before Montcalm, who, in his eagerness to reach
Quebec, had disembarked the day before to make the rest of the journey
by _calèche_. On arriving at the capital the honours were paid to the
new general by the Intendant Bigot in the absence of the Governor de
Vaudreuil, then in Montreal.[197] Speaking of the magnificence of the
dinner and the good cheer provided by Bigot, Montcalm wrote in his
journal that a "Parisian would have been surprised at the profusion of
the good things of every kind." In their turn Monseigneur de Pontbriand
and the Chevalier de Longueuil and others entertained him.

Montcalm sent a courier at once to Montreal to announce his arrival,
but contrary winds and the bad state of the roads prevented his own
departure till May 23d. Reaching Montreal on May 26th, he was received
with courtesy by the governor general, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de
Vaudreuil, the son of Philippe de Vaudreuil, Governor of New France
from 1703 to 1725. He was announced with the welcome of cannon, "an
honour which was not due me in France," he wrote in his journal, "but
in point of honours there are particular usages in the colonies."

[Illustration: MARQUIS PIERRE DE RIGAUD DE VAUDREUIL--CAVAGNAL]

The meeting was at the Château de Vaudreuil, the almost permanent
residence of the governor since the outbreak of the war and his
military headquarters during the years of 1756-1760, although Quebec
still continued to be the capital of government and the religious
Vatican of Canada till 1759. Montreal was thus a focus of activity,
of military and social splendour, such as it had never been before.
Château Vaudreuil was the centre of much official life and formality.
Staff officers, officers, soldiers and redskins, brilliant extremes
in their picturesque costumes, were to be seen hurrying to and fro,
the Esplanade and quay fronting the château presenting a busy and ever
changing coloured throng. Then there was the constant arrival of fresh
convoys, and the military movements of the soldiers through the streets
to the sound of fife and drum. All this gave Montreal an unaccustomed
animation and brilliancy. With Montcalm's advent there would soon
arrive his own fashionable _entourage_, his household staff and his
military staff from France, to add still greater _éclat_. Soon, too,
the regiments of La Sarre and Royal-Roussillon would come to invade the
town's resources and to add to its gayety, its love adventures and its
scandal, before they were sent out to various danger points to offset
the perilous war preparations now being made by the English.

Already the Béarn regiment had been sent to Niagara; those of La
Reine and Languedoc were at Carillon; Guyenne was on the road to Fort
Frontenac, whither shortly La Sarre would join them. The destination of
Royal-Roussillon regiment was not so quickly made known. The La Sarre
regiment left Quebec in two divisions on June 5th and 6th and arrived
at Montreal by water on June 13th and 16th. The Royal-Roussillon made
the journey by land, the first division leaving Quebec on June 10th
and the second on June 11th, reaching Montreal after eight or nine
days' march. Relative to the water journey, an officer of La Sarre
thus describes the arrival at Montreal: "We arrived at Montreal, where
M. le Général awaited us, to dispose of his army. Montreal is a very
large town and very exposed to conflagrations, its houses being all
built of wood. The 'ton français' prevails; the vocation for marriage
is in favour, and there are very pretty girls who entertain us. We
have already had five of our officers married. '_On y est orgueilleux
quoique pauvre, et il n'y a que le particulier qui y régit des postes
en état de suffire au train qu'ils menent._'"

The meeting of the governor general with his commander in chief may
be thus described: Montcalm was a thorough Frenchman, and Vaudreuil
a native Canadian. Born in Quebec on November 22, 1698, Vaudreuil
had served most of his time in this colony save when he exercised
the functions of governor in Louisiana from 1743 to 1745. He was the
embodiment of that _préjugé colonial_, which existed against officials
from the mother country; while Montcalm stood for a corresponding
_préjugé métropolitain_. This antipathy was the fruitful seed of
much discord, and increased the agonies of the death struggle of the
French _régime_. Therefore, although Vaudreuil received Montcalm with
affability, it was not unmixed with jealousy. Before the arrival
of Montcalm, Vaudreuil had protested to the minister of war, that
there was no need of a general officer from France at the head of
the Canadian battalions, which preferred to fight under one of their
own commanders, who understood the mode of warfare suitable in this
country, while those from France were disdainful of the Canadian
troops. This was the prevalent opinion shared by the greater part of
the Canadian officers. Indeed, it was the ordinary conflict between
colonial susceptibility and European haughtiness, not unknown even
today.

The interview, however, seems to have left a good impression on both
sides. In the letter of Vaudreuil, written to d'Argenson, the minister
of war, on June 8th, and that of Montcalm to de Machault, minister of
marine, both express mutual admiration of one another. At the same
time, writing more freely to d'Argenson, his patron, Montcalm says,
"M. de Vaudreuil pays particular _respect_ to the savages, _loves_ the
Canadians, knows the country, has good sense, but is tame and a little
weak, and I get on well with him."

Vaudreuil's natural weakness for the Canadians, due to his birth and
education, was enhanced by his marriage with Fleury de la Gorgendière,
a Canadian, the widow of François de Verrier, an officer of the marine
troops, by whom she had a son and daughter. Madame de Vaudreuil had
no children by the second marriage, but she had many relatives in the
colony and maintained the reputation of being exceedingly jealous of
their advancement.

What was Montcalm's position? His commission, signed by Louis XV, at
Versailles, on March 17, 1756, places him in all things under "Our
Governor General in New France," and the instructions of his majesty to
Montcalm are still more precise. He was to be the executive officer,
with power of representation. "In a word," says his majesty, "it will
be the duty of the governor general to rule and arrange everything
for the military operations. The Sieur de Montcalm will be held to
execute the orders given him. He will, however, be able to make
suitable representations in accordance with the projects entrusted
to his execution. But if the governor general believes he has reason
sufficient, not to defer to them, and to persist in his dispositions,
the Sieur de Montcalm will conform without difficulty or delay." This
definition of duties, while it clipped somewhat the wings of the
initiative of the ambitious maréchal de camp, nevertheless had the
merit of clearness.

Let us now see the threefold composition of the forces in the
little Canadian army, over which Vaudreuil and Montcalm are to have
control--the land troops, the marine and the militia forces. The
militia or yeomanry forces were composed of all the male population
from fifteen to sixty years of age. This was, as we know, the
oldest part of the service. Every parish and district had been
organized in companies with _capitaines de la côte_, chosen from
the most substantial men of the district, who would muster their
men when required for war purposes. Their dress and equipment was
similar to the regular soldiers and when in service they were fed
at the king's expense, but received no pay, although they had a
right for remuneration when called upon for _corvées_, for convoys
and transports. In 1756 the Canadian militia numbered as high as
14,000 men, but, except at the end of the war, when the final crisis
approached, there were never more than 4,000 in active service at once,
since the necessity of having to attend to their crops made frequent
returns to their parishes imperative. Canada had reason to be proud of
her sturdy and brave yeoman militia.

The second military arm was the marine service or the marine troops.
Not that they served on the sea or inland waters, but they were so
denominated because they were under the jurisdiction of the minister
of marine affairs. This service had been in Canada for over fifty
years and constituted a permanent standing force, having charge of the
garrisons and posts, and were employed for the defence of the frontier
and the maintenance of order in the colony. Most of the officers were
Canadian by birth; some came from France and became settled colonists
here. Many of the prominent explorers and military leaders had held
commissions in this force. In 1756 these troops formed thirty companies
of sixty-five men, making a total of 1,950 men.

The third and main branch was the land troops or regulars, specially
sent from France. We have seen this method pursued before in former
emergencies. At present the troops in Canada were the second battalions
of the regular infantry belonging to the regiments, called after the
names of the provinces or regions, from which they were raised, of La
Reine, Guyenne, Béarn and Languedoc. These made a contingent of 2,100
men, being composed of forty-eight companies of fusiliers of forty
men each, and four companies of grenadiers of forty-five men each.
Disasters on the voyage out, sickness, and the battle at Lake George
had reduced their numbers, at the arrival of Montcalm, to an effective
force of 1,652 men. Add to these the 1,050 men belonging to the second
battalions of the La Sarre and Royal-Roussillon Regiments. In the
month of June, of this year 1756, the Chevalier de Montreuil, major
general of the troops, made the following recapitulation: La Reine,
327 men; Languedoc, 326; Guyenne, 492; Béarn, 498; La Sarre, 515;
Royal-Roussillon, 520; to which it is necessary to add 150 volunteers
and 918 recruits, giving a total of 3,752 men, not counting the
officers.

Such were the three forces to be directed from the military capital of
Montreal.

Montcalm, settled in Montreal, had a busy time keeping his staff in
constant activity, only hoping, however, for peace for that winter,
which was not to be. Among those whom he met constantly were M. Doreil
of the commissary department, the boastful and somewhat inefficient
Chevalier de Montreuil, adjutant major general of the troops, and
the notorious Intendant Bigot, who came from Quebec to organize
the provisions of the regiments and whose activity, at first, very
favourably impressed Montcalm.

He soon became acquainted with his red allies. On June 3d, according
to his journal, he received a complimentary visit from the Iroquois of
Sault St. Louis, who came with their "ladies" to compliment him on his
arrival and to felicitate Onontio, the governor. They gave Montcalm
a necklace and he assured them that he would visit them in return.
Writing on June 16th to his wife, he describes this occasion: "They
are a dirty gentry, even when fresh from their toilet, at which they
pass all their time; you would hardly believe it, but the men always
carry to war, along with their tomahawks and guns, a mirror, by which
they daub their faces with various colours, and arrange feathers on
their heads, and rings in their ears and noses. They think it a great
beauty to mutilate the lobes of their ears at an early age, so as to
stretch them till they fall on the shoulders. Often they wear no shirt
at all, but only a laced jacket; you would take them for devils or
masqueraders. They would exercise the patience of an angel. Moreover,
these gentry wage war with astonishing cruelty, slaying women and
children alike: They scalp you most skilfully, an operation from which
one ordinarily dies.... In general all that Père Charlevoix[198] says is
true--with the exception of their burning their prisoners; that has
almost gone out of fashion."

Meanwhile the military plans were being completed. As news came that
the English were mostly menacing the frontier of Lake St. Sacrement
(Lake George), it was decided to send the Royal-Roussillon Regiment to
Carillon (called by the savages Ticonderoga), where the forces were
concentrating. Thither also, at the command of the governor, went
Montcalm, on June 27th, accompanied by the Chevaliers de Lévis and
Montreuil. There he worked hard for twelve days with indefatigable
zeal, preparing the forts to be able to resist English attacks and
organizing the military and commissariat departments. Leaving Lévis
in command, he returned to Montreal on July 16th at the call of the
governor. He had had his first experience of the home infantry and the
differences between Canadian conditions in campaigning and those of
France. He had learned that the Canadian soldier was very independent,
and that the savages needed special treatment. Yet he wrote to
his family at this time that he had succeeded at present with the
Canadians, and with the Indians, whose bearings he had also taken.

Montcalm was recalled to undertake the siege and capture of Chouaguen
(Oswego), a stronghold of the English and the key of the situation.
This project, being meditated by Vaudreuil from the first days of his
governorship, was undoubtedly hazardous and problematical, and Montcalm
and Lévis and the others from France had always feared failure, unless
a combination of lucky conditions should favour them. Vaudreuil, in
spite of a certain hesitancy, still believed it was possible, as indeed
did Bigot, and Montcalm set out from Lachine on July 21st with his
_aide-de-camp_ Bougainville. They made their portages successfully
around the rapids of the Sault, so that they reached the post of La
Présentation on the 27th, arriving at Frontenac on the 29th, where he
hoped to find the battalions of La Sarre, Guyenne and Béarn already
there, with de Bourlamaque, M. Rigaud de Vaudreuil, brother of the
governor general, and a body of colonial troops, Canadians and Indians,
to the number of 1,500 men, and engineers and artillery, and then he
would attempt to make a landing, hard by Oswego, in preparation for the
siege. We cannot follow the story of the fall of Oswego. Suffice it to
say that within ten days after embarking from Frontenac on August 4th,
Fort Chouaguen or Oswego, hitherto thought impregnable, had capitulated
on August 14th to Montcalm.

That same night he sent an officer to Vaudreuil at Montreal to bear to
him the five flags of the regiments of Shirley, Pepperell and Schuyler.
The story of the riotous sacking of the post is sad reading but
Montcalm cannot be justly accused of countenancing it. "The Canadians
and Indians," says Parkman (Wolfe and Montcalm, I, p. 413), "broke
through all restraint and fell to plundering. There was an opening of
rum barrels and a scene of drunkenness in which some of the prisoners
had their share; while others tried to escape in the confusion and were
tomahawked by the excited savages. Many more would have been butchered
but for the efforts of Montcalm, who by unstinted promises succeeded in
appeasing his ferocious allies, whom he dared not offend. 'It will cost
the king,' he says, 'eight or ten thousand _livres_ in presents.'"

From the 16th to the 20th of August the work of demolition was
continued. By the 21st at the place where five days before the powerful
English fort of Oswego stood nothing but burning ruins remained, on
which Montcalm caused a cross and a stake with the arms of France to be
placed, bearing these inscriptions:

  _In hoc signo vincunt_," and
  _Manibus date lilia plenis._"

After the fall of Oswego, Montcalm having embarked on August 23d,
arrived at Montreal on the 26th, wearied out but buoyed up by his
triumph after a month's absence, during which he had traversed over six
hundred and fifty miles, taken three forts, captured a war flotilla,
made prisoner an army and seized from the enemy an immense store
of provisions, and secured for France the undisputed rule over the
majestic Ontario. Chouaguen had been the apple of discord and its fall
was a decisive success for the colony.

The joyful colony met in the churches to celebrate the victory. In
the parish church of Montreal, three days after Montcalm's return,
an imposing ceremony occurred at which the solemn Te Deum was sung
and M. de Bourlamaque and M. de Rigaud, in the name of the governor
general, publicly presented the conquered English flags to the Abbé de
Tonnancour, a member of the diocesan chapter. Outside the church the
public joy was made manifest by many effusions of the Canadian muse.
One set of song verses from an anonymous Pindar, addressed to the
governor general, comes down to us, beginning:

    _Nous célebrons du grand Vaudreuil
        La sagesse et la gloire
    Toute l'Angleterre est en deuil
          Au bruit de sa victoire._

The bishop of Quebec, Monseigneur de Pontbriand, published a
_mandement_, of thanksgiving, full of patriotic enthusiasm and
appreciation of Vaudreuil, and calling the taking of Oswego the
"action, the most memorable that has taken place since the founding of
the colony, ... it is the more astonishing since we have had only three
of our men killed and ten to twelve wounded. The Canadians, the troops
from France and the colonial forces, even the savages, have signalized
by their mutual emulation their zeal for the fatherland and the service
of his majesty."

Not all were entirely pleased with this _mandement_, for there were
allusions to "timid spirits," which Montcalm and his chief officers
took to refer to themselves for their previous doubts on the hazardous
possibility of capturing Fort Chouaguen, for they knew the prevalent
opinion, held by the Canadians, that the French troops, because
unaccustomed, did not understand guerrilla warfare, in which, however,
the colonial troops had become very expert. Vaudreuil was triumphant,
success justified him. In his dispatches to the minister he has no
praise for Montcalm, whom he represents as timorous, vacillating, and
indisposed to undertake the siege. On the other hand, the Canadian
officers, Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, his brother, and the Chevalier
de Mercier, were accredited with being the moving and dominant spirits.
Family pride manifests itself frequently in such expressions, as "my
brother" did this, "my brother" did that, while his own egotism finds
play in similar uses of the first person, varied by "My brother and I."

Montcalm's private judgment of these was written on August 17th from
Oswego to de Lévis at Carillon: "Do you remember that Mercier is an
ignoramus and a weak man ... all the rest are not worth the trouble
of speaking about, even my first lieutenant general, Rigaud." Of the
Canadian militia he wrote this appreciation to d'Argenson, the minister
of war, "I have employed them usefully but not at works exposed to the
fire of the enemy. They know neither discipline nor subordination;
_j'en ferais dans six mois des grenadiers, et, actuellement, je me
garderais bien d'y faire autant de cas que le malheureux Monsieur
Dieskau y en a fait, pour avoir trop écouté les propos avantageux des
Canadiens, qui se croient, sur tous les points, la première nation du
monde_."

Once more in the above conflict we see the presence of the _préjugé
colonial_ and the _préjugé métropolitain_ again in evidence. It existed
between the two protagonists of the period, Vaudreuil and Montcalm, and
it was there with the officers and rank and file of both parties. Five
months of acquaintance had formed for Vaudreuil a profound aversion
to Montcalm, while the latter judged the former a mediocre and vain
man, suspected his sincerity, thought him a double dealer, a victim to
favoritism, and conceived an antipathy which unhappily daily increased.

After the fall of Oswego, Montcalm visited St. Jean and Carillon,
and as it became evident by the end of October that the campaign was
finished for the year, the troops were disposed for winter quarters,
the regiment of La Sarre being placed at Pointe aux Trembles, Longue
Pointe, Rivière des Prairies, Lachine and Pointe Claire; that of Béarn
at Boucherville, Longueuil and La Prairie, and the Languedoc Regiment
at Montreal itself. The other regiments from France were placed at
Quebec, Chambly, St. Charles and St. Antoine, along the Richelieu
river. Three Rivers had no French troops.

Montcalm spent the winter in Montreal, with the exception of a trip
to Quebec in January, for a month. On November 24th his letter to
Bourlamaque from Montreal gives an indication of a time of leisure,
for amusement. "M. le Chevalier (de Lévis) passes the time socially
at Madame de Pénisseault's house. He has been to a great supper party
at M. Martel's. As for myself I play at backgammon, or I have a
hand at whist with my general, Madame Varin occasionally, or Madame
d'Eschambault." From the end of November to the end of December the
audiences with visiting delegations of Indians occupied the attention
of Vaudreuil and the military authorities. Montcalm spent the New
Year's day alone but on January 3d he joined Vaudreuil and de Lévis
at Quebec, whither they had gone on December 31st. His object was to
visit the troops garrisoned there under Bourlamaque. The presence
of the distinguished visitors in Quebec gave rise to a series of
brilliant receptions and balls in an already brilliant season, at
which the Intendant Bigot surpassed even himself by his splendour. The
fashionable gayety of the capital, then numbering about twelve hundred
souls, at this period of peril, is saddening, being only equalled by
the venality and corruption abounding. Montcalm reports, "Quebec has
appeared to me as a town of very high tone; I do not believe that in
France there are a dozen surpassing Quebec in society." He had to note
that excessive gaming was the order of the day. The Intendant Bigot
indulged his taste in it and Vaudreuil also complacently permitted the
extravagances, although many of the officers were ruined by them.

During his stay in Quebec, Montcalm carried out the policy, so
energetically inaugurated by Talon, of inducing the soldiery to marry
with the view of settling down. But he did not approve so much of the
marriages of his officers, for he feared that they would make mediocre
marriages, as some indeed did, with the rashness of youth. Montcalm
enjoyed his stay in Quebec; its gayeties appealed to him more than
those of Montreal, whither he returned shortly.

During the months of February, March and April, Vaudreuil organized
from Montreal one of those winter war parties at which the Canadians
were past masters. Having received news at Three Rivers, where he was
ill from pleurisy, that there had been a brush between an English and
a French party at Carillon, he conceived the project of sending a war
party to try a _coup de main_ against Fort William Henry, at the head
of Lake St. Sacrement (Lake George). This enterprise, directed from
Montreal, resulted in an appreciable success, in that it broke down the
preparations of the English in that part, for a campaign against the
French.

This war aroused fresh dissensions between Vaudreuil and Montcalm,
the latter complaining of the expense and also imagining that the
governor wished to put in relief the colonial and militia forces to the
detriment of the battalions from France. Montcalm in his letter to the
minister of marine on April 24th could not, however, but acknowledge
the success of these severe manoeuvres, with their snowshoe marches
over lakes and through forests, and terrible tempests, and the bivouacs
by night under the cold stars. Yet he added with pride that "the
Canadians have been astonished to see that our officers and soldiers
have not been a whit behind them in method of war and march, to which
they were not accustomed. It must, however, be admitted that in Europe
they have no idea of the hardships which one is obliged to endure
during the six weeks of marching and sleeping, as it were, always on
the snow or the ice, and of being reduced to bread and lard, and often
having to drag or to carry provisions, for fifteen days." He also
mentions that the winter had been very severe, "the thermometer being
many times down to twenty-seven, often eighteen to twenty, and nearly
always from twelve to fifteen, _minus_. There has been an astonishing
quantity of snow."

Yet these military preoccupations did not hinder the gay routine of
social engagements at headquarters during this winter of 1757. The
presence of the governor general, Montcalm, de Lévis and the military
staff gave much éclat and life to Montreal with its succession of
balls, receptions and dinners. Never had Montreal seen such a carnival.
In all this, as befitting his high rank, the general had to share. In
his correspondence with Bourlamaque, Montcalm gives us in his letter of
February 14th a picture of the fashionable society of the time.

"Since being here I pass my time giving big dinners to parties of
fifteen or sixteen persons and sometimes suppers, _aussi nombreux
sans en être plus gaillards. Il faut souhaiter que l'hiver prochain
on en puisse faire qui puissent dédommager._ On Sunday, I gathered
together the ladies from France, with the exception of Madame Parfouru,
who did me the honour to visit me, three days ago; in seeing her I
perceived that love has powerful attractions, of which one can
render no reasonable account; not by the impression which she has made
on my part, but especially by that which she has made on her husband.
Wednesday, a gathering at the house of Madame Varin;[199] Thursday, a
ball at that of the Chevalier de Lévis, who had invited sixty-five
'dames ou demoiselles.' Thirty would have been enough, so many men
being away in the war. The hall was brilliantly illuminated; it is as
large as the intendant's; much ceremony and attentive hospitality,
refreshments, in abundance, all the night, of every kind and species,
and the party did not leave till seven o'clock in the morning. I,
however, who had given up the gay life of my stay at Quebec, went to
bed at an early hour. I had had, however, the same day, a supper for
eight ladies, in honour of Madame Varin. Tomorrow I shall give another
for half a dozen. I do not know yet to whom it is to be given, but
I am inclined to think it will be Madame Rochebeaucour. The gallant
chevalier is giving us another ball. The public imagined that our
_aides-de-camp_ were to give a _mardi gras_; but I have advised them to
wait until after Easter and after the success of our detachment, when
it will be more suitable to give public marks of joy."

REGIME]

Amidst these gayeties and his official duties in preparation for the
hazardous campaigns of spring, Montcalm did not neglect to write to his
family, for whom he prepares, for the departure of the boats in spring,
chatty accounts of his daily doings, interspersing them with amusing
Canadian sketches. He tells his wife on April 16th of the doings of his
household staff, his men, the gayeties. "Everything is very expensive.
One must live according to one's rank and I do it. Every day, sixteen
persons at table. Once a week with the governor general, and with M.
de Lévis, who also lives well. He has given three fine balls. As for
myself,--up to Lent, besides the dinners, great supper parties with
ladies three times a week." He speaks of the games of chance he could
not refuse, the impromptu dancing parties after the suppers; very
expensive, not very entertaining and oftentimes boresome. "... I have
had my assistant cook married, for I am bent on peopling the colony.
Eighty soldier marriages this winter and two of officers.... The ladies
are witty, courteous and pious. At Quebec, they are gamesters; at
Montreal conversations and the dance prevail." He speaks highly of his
good relations with de Lévis, Bourlamaque, the colonial and militia
troops, the savages; of his intense desire to rejoin them and his
impatient desire for peace; of the likelihood of the commencement of
military operations on the frontier of Lake St. Sacrement on the 12th
or 15th of May. "... Adieu, my sweetheart, I adore and love you, I
embrace my daughter, my mother."

The winter gayeties of Montreal this year did not close without
an additional zest being imparted by the visit of a contingent of
ladies from Quebec. "Mesdames de St. Ours[200] and de Beaubassin and
Mesdemoiselles de Longueuil and Drucour arrived yesterday evening,"
wrote Montcalm on March 14th to Bourlamaque at Quebec; this meant
renewed exchange of hospitality.

Meanwhile spring had arrived and as yet the boats from France had not
appeared with the provisions for the troops. Quebec was menaced with a
famine. The intendant was obliged to distute 2,000 bushels of grain
to the _habitants_ to seed their lands and there was a fear of want of
flour, as the 14th of May had already passed. Montreal, less poor in
wheat, sent some down to Quebec. This penury paralyzed operations, for
it was impossible to put the troops in motion without provisions. Their
objective was the frontier of Lake St. Sacrement. The governor wished
to concentrate at Carillon as great an army as possible, to attempt the
siege of Fort William Henry. This scarcity of provisions became daily
more alarming, as May came to an end. There was talk of horse flesh
being supplied instead of pork. At last the news came that the _David_
and the _Jason_ of Bordeaux, laden with provisions, arms, and men, were
coming up the river, bringing news from France, that would give new
zest to the conversation, after being so long sequestered, during the
winter seclusion, from contact with the mother country.

The ships brought news of grave changes in France. The result of the
alliance between Austria and France, concluded on May 1, 1756, had been
that France had now become embroiled in a great international war.
There had also been an attempt of assassination on the life of Louis
XV. But what particularly affected the government of Montreal was the
information that the minister of war, d'Argenson, and of marine, de
Machault, had been succeeded respectively by M. de Paulmy and M. de
Mauras--due to the influence of Madame de Pompadour. These changes were
not looked upon with too much favour by those responsible for Canada in
the critical period it was now in. To Montcalm the serious loss of his
patron, d'Argenson, was somewhat mitigated by the knowledge that M. de
Paulmy, the minister succeeding, was d'Argenson's nephew. The change
of M. de Machault, with whom Montcalm had had less relations, was less
distasteful, as the new minister, de Mauras, was the brother-in-law
of Madame Hérault, the protectress of his first _aide-de-camp_,
Bougainville; moreover, there were common ties between the de Hérault
family and that of Montcalm.

The vessels from France had lightened the strain of provisioning the
army, but the needs of the army and the gatherings at Montreal of a
vast number of redskins, attracted by the success at Oswego to take
up the axe against the English and share in the campaign, caused
Vaudreuil, acting on a suggestion made by Montcalm as early as March,
to send Martel, the storekeeper, around the Montreal district to
commandeer rations for a month for 12,800 men. On June 22d, more than
eight hundred of these wild allies were encamped around Montreal, and
300 more were expected from Détroit. According to the enumeration in
Montcalm's journal there were: 400 Ottawans,[201] 100 Poutéouatamies,
about four hundred Puants, Sakés, Folles-Avoines and Iowas. The latter
had never been seen before at Montreal and their language was unknown.

The streets and public places saw an incessant passing to and fro of
dusky braves, armed for the warpath, with lances, bows and arrows, with
bodies almost entirely naked, or loosely draped in their beaver or
buffalo coverings, vividly painted in red or blue or black, with their
heads shaven except for the topknots, in which were stuck the tufts of
multicoloured feathers. A great number were of colossal stature; and
these copper-coloured giants, fierce in aspect, guttural in speech, and
strikingly tattooed, moved around the town, ight to the citizens,
and mingled with the French officers and soldiers, whose brilliant
European uniforms produced a strange contrast with their barbaric
but picturesque accoutrements. Sometimes they would be seen wending
their way, with their interpreters, to the Château de Vaudreuil to pay
their respects to the governor, whose inexhaustible patience offered
no rebuff to their interminable deputations. Now, they would go in a
band to carry on their Indian dances before the houses of the chief
officials.

Montreal with its bronzed soldiery, who had warred beyond the Rhine,
crossed the Alps and braved the suns of Italy, presented in this
meeting of two races, two civilizations so widely divergent, a
wonderfully moving and dramatic spectacle. But there was a pitiable
reverse to this picture. At times when the strong liquors had seized
them, their camps became veritable pandemoniums, and revolting scenes
were enacted. Already presentiments of horrible extravagances were
experienced by the officers from France, such as Bougainville, who
wrote of his fierce, drunken and bloodthirsty allies to Madame de
Hérault on June 30th: "I will tell you that we count on two sieges and
a battle, and your child trembles at the horrors he will be forced
to witness. There will be difficulty in restraining the savages from
up country, who are the fiercest of men and great cannibals. Listen
to what their chiefs said just three days ago to M. de Montcalm, 'My
father, do not count upon our giving quarter to the English. We have
with us young men, who have not yet drunk of this broth (blood). This
fresh flesh has led them hither from the ends of the universe. They
have to learn to wield the knife and to plunge it into an English
heart.' Such are our companions, ... what a spectacle for a human
heart!"

Everything was now ready for the campaign. By the 18th of June Montcalm
was with de Lévis at St. John; thence he proceeded to Chambly to
inspect the troops, and the military roads, and suitable places for
camping. By the end of June the troops were ordered to move, and on
July 2d de Lévis went to take command of the troops at Carillon. On
July 9th Vaudreuil gave his instructions to General Montcalm. He was to
take Fort George (or Fort William Henry) and then, on its fall, he was
to go to the siege of Fort Lydius (or Fort Edward), situated fifteen
miles from Fort George and from Lake St. Sacrement. That same day
Montcalm with Bougainville went to the Lake of Two Mountains to join
in the war song with the Algonquins and the Nipissings of the district
and he returned to Montreal on July 11th, having received the name of
Goroniatsigoa, that is to say, the "Great Sky in Anger." On the 12th,
Montcalm departed for Montreal for St. John, which he left on July 15th
with the colonial officers, de Rigaud, Dumas, de St. Ours, de Bonne
and many others under the escort of the Guyenne grenadiers and a small
detachment of Ottawans. Three days afterwards he arrived at Carillon.

Meanwhile Vaudreuil remained at Montreal, directing the war from his
cabinet. We cannot follow this campaign in detail, but we may pursue
the fortunes of Montcalm somewhat. On July 29th he found himself, with
7,819 men, advancing to Fort William Henry, his force composed of 2,570
land troops; colonials and militia, 3,470; gunners, 180; and Indian
allies, 1,599. On August 1st he began the siege of William Henry, held
by Colonel Monroe with 2,200 men. On August 9th Colonel Monroe perforce
capitulated, having hung out the white flag at 7 a. m. that morning.
It was a glorious victory, but marred by the shameful extravagances,
feared by Montcalm and the others, of the Indians, who, glutted with
victory, broke the capitulation agreement.

This event may be summed up in the account given in Bancroft's "History
of the United States," II, p. 467:

"To make the capitulation inviolably binding on the Indians, Montcalm
summoned their war chiefs to council. The English were to depart under
an escort with the honors of war on a pledge not to serve against the
French for eighteen months; they were to abandon all but their private
effects; every Canadian or French Indian captive was to be liberated.
The Indians applauded; the capitulation was signed. Late on the 9th the
French entered the fort and the English retired to their entrenched
camp. Montcalm had kept all intoxicating drinks from the savages;
but they obtained them of the English, and all night long were wild
with dances, songs and revelry. The Abenakis of Acadia inflamed other
tribes by recalling their sufferings from English perfidy and power. At
daybreak, they gathered round the entrenchments, and as the terrified
English soldiers filed off, began to plunder them, and incited one
another to use the tomahawk. Twenty, perhaps even thirty,[202] persons
were massacred, while very many were made prisoners. Officers and
soldiers, stripped of everything, fled to the woods, to the fort, to
the tents of the French. To arrest the disorder Lévis plunged into
the tumult, daring death a thousand times. French officers received
wounds in rescuing the captives, and stood at their tents as sentries
over those they recovered. 'Kill me,' cried Montcalm, using prayers
and menaces and promises, 'but spare the English who are under my
protection,' and he urged the troops to defend themselves. The march
to Fort Edward (Fort Lydius) was a flight; not more than six hundred
reached there in a body. From the French camp Montcalm collected
together more than four hundred, who were dismissed with a great
escort, and he sent Vaudreuil[203] to ransom those whom the Indians had
carried away."

Bougainville's journal tells how "the savages (those from up country)
arrived in a mob at Montreal with about two hundred English. M. de
Vaudreuil reprimanded them for having violated the capituion treaty;
they excused themselves and threw the blame on the domiciliated tribes
settled with the French. It was announced that they must give up the
English prisoners unjustly captured and they would be paid two barrels
of _eau-de-vie_ apiece for them." Even with this shameful ransom the
savages released their prisoners only with reluctance, "for," says
Bougainville, "on the 15th, at two o'clock in the afternoon, in the
presence of the whole town, they killed one of them, put him into the
kettle and forced his unfortunate compatriots to feed on him."

On the same evening, at Lake George, the columns of smoke from the
heaps of cinders and the last flickering flames from the dying fires
were the only indications of the site where eight days before the
bastions of Fort William Henry had stood. The campaign was virtually
over and Montcalm returned to Montreal at the beginning of September,
a victorious general. But he had not attempted to take Fort Edward
or Lydius, much to the chagrin of Vaudreuil. The reasons for this,
as given by his _aide-de-camp_, in a letter to the minister of war
on August 18th, seem sufficient. "The extreme difficulty of making a
portage of ten leagues without oxen or horses, with an army almost
worn out with fatigue and want of food, the lack of ammunition, the
necessity of sending the Canadians back to gather in their harvests,
already ripe, the departure of all the redskins from the upper
countries, as well as nearly all of the more civilized ones nearer
home: such are the invincible obstacles which did not permit us to
march immediately to Fort Edward." Grave reasons, enough, but they
did not satisfy the governor general, who had watched the situation
from the comfortable quarters of Government House, eighty leagues from
the theatre of war, and he did not hesitate to send his complaints
to France, insinuating the inefficiency of Montcalm, his strained
relations with the colonial officers and want of consideration for
the home forces and unwise treatment of the savages. On the other
hand, the letters of Bougainville go to show the extreme popularity
of the general with all classes. We cannot enter into a discussion
of the rights and wrongs of their bitter controversy; we quote it
as a sidelight, illustrating the division in the highest circles of
Montreal during this period--the _préjugé colonial_ and the _préjugé
métropolitain_, over again![204]

When Montcalm went to Quebec in September after the victory of William
Henry he tells us that he found the air of the town "very commercial
and stock jobbing." It was the time of the year when the card money
was exchanged for letters of exchange on the treasurer of the marine
department in France. The same activity would therefore be engaging
Montreal. From September 1st to September 20th the people were bringing
in to the treasurer the card money and the money orders which, besides
the current coinage, which was very scarce, constituted the monetary
system of the colony. The card money, created by the Intendant de
Meulles, was equivalent to our bills on the government of Canada. But
with the increase of the public expenditures, it was thought fit to
have recourse to another instrument of exchange, and the intendants
had sent out, under their sole signatures, "ordonnances" bearing an
order number and an indication of their nominal value, inscribed in
figures and in writing. These cards and ordonnances had currency only
in the limits of Canada. It was necessary, therefore, that they should
be transformed into other values, for commercial needs of importation
and the financial relations between the colony and France. Thus, every
autumn the treasurer exchanged them for paper negotiable outside the
country. From the 1st of September to the 20th he gave "bonds" or
their equivalent, and these were taken from the 1st of October to the
20th to the bureaux of the intendant, who gave in return the letters
of exchange on the marine deparment of France. Thus the colony paid
its bill to the mother country. The system worked well till 1753.
But afterwards, owing to the deplorable financial conditions and the
growing expenditures in Canada, the ministers adopted a system of
delayed payments in three terms. Montcalm, in his journal, alludes to
this practice. "The intendant regulates the terms of payments. Last
year they were made payable during the year in three payments. This
year they are made payable in three years, viz., a quarter in 1758, a
half in 1759, and another quarter in 1760."[205]

In the middle of October, news came to the garrison of Montreal by an
open letter of Montcalm on October 14th, sent through de Lévis, to the
lieutenant colonels of his regiments, of the retrenchments ordered in
the food supplies owing to the harvests having been ruined by frosts
and rains that year, and to the provisions expected from France not
having been sent through error. "We are about to find ourselves," ended
the letter in an eloquent and soldierly appeal, "in most critical
circumstances for want of good supplies. We are in need of bread this
year; the means that they are about taking to supply it will make us
in need of meat next year. Whatever difficulties the troops in the
country experience in living with the _habitants_, their soldiers
will have less to complain of than will those who are in the town
garrisons. The times are going to be harder than at Prague in certain
respects. I am, at the same time, persuaded that this is going to be
the finest opportunity of glory for the land troops, as I am sure, in
advance, that they will lend themselves to it entirely in the best
taste, and that we shall hear no complaints or jeremiads on the rarity
of supplies, seeing there is no remedy. Thus we are ready to give the
example of frugality necessary by the retrenchment of our table fare
and expenses, and I venture to say that that officer, who in place of
priding himself on his good cheer, on spending and entertaining, like
every French officer accustomed to notions of rank and liberality, will
live the most meanly, will give the surest marks of his love for his
country, for the king's service, and will be worthy of the greatest
praise."

This letter, which did honour to the general, was written in
consequence of a meeting called in Quebec on October 13th by
Vaudreuil, at which Montcalm, Bigot, Péan and the commissary
general, Cadet, were present to consider the terrible question of
failing provisions. The Intendant Bigot submitted an _exposé_ of the
situation. The commissariat department contained only 1,500 quarts of
flour; the quests in the southern districts had only returned 2,000
hundredweights; the government of Montreal could only furnish 600, to
that of Quebec.

It was then decided that, commencing from November 1st, each soldier
would receive the following rations every eight days: a half pound of
bread every day, and a quarter pound of peas, six pounds of beef and
two pounds of codfish for the eight days. In December they would begin
to be given horseflesh--this to continue in January and February;
pork was to be kept for the autumn. Montcalm made several judicious
propositions, one being that soldiers should be dispersed into those
villages where none were as yet quartered, and that the example of
frugality, and retrenchment should be immediately set by himself, the
governor general, the intendant and the others. This self-denying
ordinance was at once generously acted upon. Writing to de Lévis next
day, enclosing the open letter as above, Montcalm, speaking of the new
régime of retrenchment, says: "All the colony applauds; the intendant
not so much. He loves display."

Yet, sad to relate, in spite of these noble resolutions, the gayeties
among the rulers of the colony, were soon revived at Quebec, while
misery and famine were gnawing at the vitals of the common people.
Bigot continued giving his luxurious receptions; music, sumptuous
fêtes, dances and balls, illicit amours and gaming, went on fast and
furiously in his house, with Vaudreuil complacently assisting. Even
Montcalm was present at the great banquets and lost his money at the
gaming tables like the rest. Many of his officers were becoming ruined.
At times he would get qualms of conscience and he would write in his
journal: "We are amusing ourselves and thinking of nothing; all is
going and will go to the devil!" Again: "In spite of the public misery,
balls and fearful gaming!" Then he would write to the batallions that
if they played in any but the privileged houses (such as those of the
intendant "out of the consideration due to him") he would punish them,
adding that even in this case, he would expect them to play discreetly.
Then he would make a resolution only to go to the intendant's house in
the morning. "The tone of decency, of polite manners, of good society
is banished from the home where it ought to be." Yet he frequented the
house of Bigot and that of his paramour, La Péan, as at Montreal de
Lévis was the constant visitor of Madame Pénisseault.

Meanwhile misery reigned in the colony. The people in Quebec continued
to have no bread. In the country places wheat was rare, and an
ordinance was passed to prevent the inhabitants from milling the grain
necessary for seeding purposes.

From October 19th the rations of the troops had been reduced to a pound
of bread, a quarter pound of pork and four ounces of peas. On November
1st, they were further reduced. Finally in December the troops and the
people had to eat horseflesh. At Montreal when the first distribution
of this was made it was perceived that a revolt was fermenting among
them and that they had been incited by the people to make resistance.
Being warned that the soldiers were refusing the rations and were
leaving the canteen, de Lévis ran thither, ordered the company to be
reassembled and in their presence made them cut some horseflesh for
himself and commanded the grenadiers also to take some. These wished
to make some representations, but he checked them, enjoining on them
obedience and threatening to hang the first man that flinched, adding
that he would listen to them after the distribution.

The grenadiers, thus subdued, took their meat and their example was
followed by all the companies. Then they had the liberty to air their
grievances. After having listened to them, de Lévis harangued them,
disabusing them of the popular prejudice being aroused against
horseflesh. "Horse meat was a healthy dish; that it was often eaten
in besieged towns; that he would have an eye to it that the animals
slaughtered should be in good condition; that he himself dined on it
daily;[206] that the land troops ought to give a good example, etc."
There were no more difficulties. They seem even to have taken to the
dish, according to the following incident related in de Lévis' journal:
"On 'the day of the Kings' (January 6), 1758, eight grenadiers of the
Béarn regiment brought M. de Lévis a dish of horse meat prepared in
their own fashion, which was very good. The chevalier made them sit
down and dine, and ordered them some wine and two dishes of horse
prepared by his own cooks, who proved to be not as good as theirs. In
addition he gave them four louis, so that the company should celebrate
the feast and drink to his health."

The ladies of Montreal were among the first to stir up resistance.
When the first partial substitution of horseflesh for beef was made,
they trouped tumultuously to the doors of the Château Vaudreuil. The
governor allowed four of them to enter and asked them what they wanted.
They replied that they wanted bread. Vaudreuil told them that he had
none to give them; that even the troops were on short rations, but that
he was going to kill horses and cattle to assist the poor in this time
of misery. They replied that horseflesh was repugnant to them; that the
horse was the friend of man; that religion forbade it to be killed, and
that they would rather die than eat it. The governor then told them
that this was mere nonsense; that horse was good meat, and he dismissed
them, affirming that if they created any more disturbance he would put
them in prison and hang half of them.

Thus was the "hunger strike" of 1757 dealt with.

The letters of Montcalm from Montreal, which have been carefully
studied by M. Thomas Chapais in his "Montcalm," published in 1911,
reveal to us a sad state of corruption and venality in high places
at Quebec and Montreal. We may quote M. Chapais' estimate of the
situation. In answer to the charge that Montcalm hated the Canadians
he says: "This is not so; he loved our people and appreciated their
real qualities at their true value. He wrote to M. Moras (the minister
of marine) on July 11, 1767: 'What a colony! What a people!... They
are all thoroughly men of character and courage!' He had sympathy for
the 'Canadian simple habitant,' who for his part loved and respected
him, and Montcalm had reason to believe, as he said, that he was
popular. But he had little esteem for a great number of the Canadian
high functionaries and officers of the country. He criticized their
vanity, their spirit of boastfulness, their duplicity and their
unscrupulousness. We believe that he was too inclined to generalize
to the point of pushing his antipathies too far. He did not guard
himself against the _anti-colonial prejudice_, with which the troops
of the line were certainly affected and which, in spite of himself,
made his judgment err at times. A Canadian historian is wounded in
his national '_amour propre_' in reading the journal and letters of
Montcalm. The allusions to Canadian insincerity, Canadian braggadocio,
Canadian rudeness, occurred too frequently for our liking. And we
rightly find that the spirit of ill-humour and caustic carping is too
easily indulged in, to the detriment of the sons of the soil. But we
must not, for this reason, tax with injustice and with blind prejudice
all the severe strictures passed by Montcalm. Hélas! We are forced to
agree that he had under his eyes spectacles of a nature calculated to
ruffle an honest soul and a clear-sighted mind, pretentious incapacity,
insatiable cupidity, shameless indelicacy and dishonesty. And we ought
not to be astonished that bitter expressions had been ready to mount
from his heart to his lips. Doubtless distinctions have to be made and
Montcalm knew how to make them. Thus we find frequently from his pen
eulogiums on de Villiers, de Contrecoeur, de Ligneris, de la Naudière,
de Langy, Marin and many other Canadian officers. But when he denounces
the robberies of Cadet, of Péan, of Duchesneau and of so many other
peculators, can we accuse him with injustice because these were born in
Canada?"

This leads us to speak of the "grande société" of functionaries who
were waxing rich at the public expense at Quebec and Montreal. The
chief of these was Bigot, the intendant, a Frenchman; with him were the
Canadians, Cadet, Péan, Duchesnaux; and acting in concert with them
at Montreal was the Frenchman Varin, in charge of the commissariat
department, who had associated with him Martel, the keeper of the
stores, and the Sieur de Pénisseault, whom they placed in charge of
a store to monopolize the commerce of Montreal. This is known as "La
Friponne," or "The Cheat," after the parent one at Quebec.

This notorious group of men, with whom were others less conspicuous,
were then in the very height of their successful efforts to "get rich
quick," in the system of peculation and robbery established by Bigot.

Bigot was a type of the adventurer that helped to ruin Canada. His
great objective was to make his fortune as quickly as possible. Eager
for pleasure, a dissolute gamester, fastidious in his tastes, pushing
his love of luxury to incredible excesses, he had need to make money
quickly to satisfy his craving for the enjoyments of life. Withal,
he was an intelligent, active worker, full of resources and address,
clever to surmount obstacles and even to render great services to the
country in difficult situations.

From his arrival in Canada he had joined illicitly in commerce with the
Gradis, shipowners of Bordeaux, as well as with Bréard, controller of
the marine at Quebec, whom he had interested in his business affairs in
order to buy his complicity.

The intendant juggled away the rights of His Majesty's customs in
declaring the merchandise brought in by his Bordeaux accomplices, as
that of the king. The royal stores were always found to be needing just
those articles, which their vessels always had in abundance. The sales
were concluded under fictitious names or of those who lent them for
the nefarious purpose. The controller, Bréard, complacently signed the
invoices and marked fictitious prices. Finally Bigot bought these goods
for the king at an extravagant rate. Others became associated with the
embezzlers and soon it became a public scandal. Among those daring
speculators were the infamous triumvirate, of whom two were men of low
extraction but of undoubted ability, Duchesneau, Bigot's secretary,
the son of a Quebec shoemaker; Cadet, the son of a butcher and himself
once a cattle watcher of a Charlesbourg habitant; the third was Hugues
Péan, Sieur de Levandière, son of a former adjutant at Quebec.

The illicit liaison of this man's wife with Bigot and the complacent
acquiescence of Péan in the arrangement was public property. Like Louis
XV, Bigot had his Pompadour and her influence was considerable.

The extent of misery to which these schemers drove the common people
seems almost incredible. These associates, with whom Bigot and the
triumvirate were popularly connected and whom the public designated
"la grande société" soon came to lay their hands on all "le grande
commerce." A spacious building was constructed near the intendancy,
on ground belonging to the crown. Vast storehouses were built there.
The ostensible object was to sell goods by retail, but in reality
the design was to warehouse all the goods habitually needed by the
government stores. Each year Bigot had to send to the court a list of
the goods necessary for government purposes for the coming year. This
was always left incomplete. Hence in a short time there was a dearth,
and then it was found by the luckiest of chances that the stores of the
associates always had just the desired articles in stock. Thus retail
merchants were excluded by this monopoly and prices were raised, and
the privileged establishment was baptized by the long-suffering public
under the name of "La Friponne" (the cheat).

[Illustration: LA FRIPONNE]

[Illustration: PALACE OF THE INTENDANT]

It has been thought useful to describe the methods of "La Friponne"
of Quebec in order to explain the similar one, set up in Montreal by
Varin, the head of the government commissariat here. He is described
as born in France, of low extraction, small in figure and of an
unattractive appearance, a liar, arrogant, capricious, headstrong
and a libertine. In order to become rich, in imitation of the Quebec
monopolists, he laid violent hands on the supplies for the posts above
Montreal, and not to compromise himself personally he associated
with himself Martel, the king's storekeeper of the town. Varin and
Martel equipped the camps and did large business. They set up a store
on similar lines to those at Quebec, which also the people were not
slow in nicknaming "La Friponne." Over this was placed the Sieur de
Pénisseault, an able manager, but who had the reputation of having left
France under a cloud. The newsmongers of the salons of this period
say that Péan stood in well with Madame Pénisseault regardless of
consequences until he gallantly yielded his place to a more brilliant
star in the person of the dashing Chevalier de Lévis. The morals of
Paris and Versailles were being reflected in the humbler salons of
Quebec and Montreal.

Before leaving Pénisseault it may be added that he was the appointed
agent at Montreal of Cadet, who had been appointed in 1756 commissary
general of the stores in Canada. Herein was a new opportunity
for battening on the treasury which was exercised to its utmost.
Pénisseault was assisted in Montreal by the hunchback, Maurin, deformed
in mind as in body, but a clever and avaricious trader, though at times
ostentatiously generous. These two had been terribly scourged by the
pen of the annalist of the period. ("Mémoires de Sieur de C.," p. 87.)

Another source of illicit revenue came to these latter in conjunction
with the associates of "La Grande Société," which is attested in the
final judgment rendered in Paris in 1763, when tardy justice meted
out more or less adequate reward to this ring of embezzlers. We may
conclude this chapter with General Murray's criticism as follows:

"The small salaries given by the French government to the civil
officers in general made them neglect their duty and wreck their
invention to cheat and trick both king and people. This was carried
to such a length that many instances may be cited of clerks and men
in petty offices with yearly salaries of only six or eight hundred
_livres_, raising to themselves, in the compass of three or four years,
fortunes of three or four hundred thousand." (Observation in General
Murray's Report in 1762 on the State of the Government During the
French Administration.)


NOTE

THE PECULATORS

The number of those afterwards accused of peculation[207] was fifty-five,
including the governor, Pierre de Rigaud; Marquis de Vaudreuil and
his secretary, Saint-Sauveur; the intendant, Bigot; Varin, his
sub-delegate; and Duchesneau, his secretary; Bréard, controller of the
marine department; Estèbe, the keeper of the king's stores in Quebec;
Cadet, commissary general of supplies for Canada; Corpron, merchant,
and his agent; Péan, captain and aide-major of the marine troops in
Canada; Le Mercier, the commander of artillery in Canada. All these
were well known at Montreal, but we may add to them the following who
were stationed here and who acted as the associates of the peculators
whose headquarters had been at Quebec before the change of government
to Montreal; Martel de Saint-Antoine, La Barthe, Fayolle, keepers of
the king's stores at Montreal; Maurin, Pénisseault, merchants, partners
and agents of Cadet in his offices here; Le Moyne-Despins, a merchant
employed in furnishing provisions to the army; Martel, of the marine
commissariat; and Salvat, employed in the stores department. The rest
were either commandants of forts or storekeepers.

Of the fifty-five accused, twenty-one, and these the chiefs, alone
appeared, having undergone a long imprisonment in the Bastille; the
rest were judged in their absence. The final judgment was pronounced on
December 10, 1763, of which the following is a partial résumé:

Bigot--Perpetual banishment; property confiscated; 1,000 _livres_ of
fine and 1,500,000 _livres_ restitution.

Varin--Perpetual banishment; property confiscated; 1,000 _livres_ of
fine and 800,000 _livres_ restitution.

Cadet--Nine years' banishment; 500 _livres_ of fine and 600,000
_livres_ restitution.

Duchesnaux--Five years' banishment; 50 _livres_ of fine and 300,000
_livres_ restitution.

Pénisseault--Nine years' banishment; 500 _livres_ of fine and 600,000
_livres_ restitution.

Maurin--Nine years' banishment; 500 _livres_ of fine and 600,000
_livres_ restitution.

Corpron--Condemned to be admonished in parliament; 6 _livres_ to the
poor and 600,000 _livres_ restitution.

Martel de Saint-Antoine--Six _livres_ to the poor and 100,000 _livres_
restitution.

Estèbe--Six _livres_ to the poor and 30,000 _livres_ restitution.

With incarceration of the offenders until the amounts should be paid.

The Marquis de Vaudreuil, Le Mercier and Fayolle were acquitted; La
Barthe, _hors de cours_, or "not proven." Péan's sentence was not
pronounced till June 25, 1764; he was then declared _hors de cours_,
but in view of his illegitimate gains he was condemned to restore
600,000 _livres_ and to be kept in the Bastille until restitution had
been made.


FOOTNOTES:

[201] The Ottawans or the "Sauteux" from Michilimackinac were the first
to arrive and on the 14th they waited on Montcalm to compliment him
on the victory of Oswego. The slight and small figure of the general
astonished them, but the light that leaped from the piercing eyes of
the little man revealed to them a great leader: "My father," they said,
"when we heard news of the great things you have done we counted on
finding you tall like the great pines of the forest, but now we see
you, we find the grandeur of the pines in your eyes. We look upon you
as an eagle and your children are ready to do great deeds with you."

[202] Father Roubard, who was an eye witness, says: "The massacre was
not, however, as considerable as so much fury would seem to make us
fear; it hardly amounted to forty or fifty men"; and, Lévis wrote on
his side, "that fifty scalps had been taken."

CHAPTER XLI

1758

THE VICTORY OF CARILLON

A WINTER OF GAYETY AND FOREBODING

     SIXTY LEAGUES ON THE ICE--SHIPS ARRIVE--FAMINE CEASES--ENGLISH
     MOBILIZATION--TICONDEROGA (CARILLON)--MILITARY
     JEALOUSIES--SAINT-SAUVEUR--RECONCILIATION OF MONTCALM AND
     VAUDREUIL--ENMITIES RENEWED--WINTER IN MONTREAL--HIGH COST OF
     LIVING--THE "ENCYCLOPEDIA"--AVARICE AND GRAFT--MADAME DE VAUDREUIL.


In the last week of February, 1758, Montcalm returned to Montreal.
Writing on February 22d, he adds: "I have just arrived at Montreal,
having made sixty leagues on the ice, a delightful though cold manner
of traveling." Evidently Montreal was much quieter than Quebec, for
Montcalm was now able to attend steadily to his correspondence and to
his military preparations until the opening of navigation. Meanwhile
the famine still continued; yet we find the spoilers, Varin and Bréard,
returning to France, Péan about to do the same, to put their booty in
safety, already sensing the impending crisis which will end this period
of sad memories in the last days of the French régime. At length, on
the evening of May 19th, eight vessels, laden with 7,500 quarts of
flour, arrived at Quebec, with news of some more to come, and the
spectre of famine ceased to haunt the colony.

With the arrival of the vessels came the news that interested the
military circles of Montreal; the replacement of M. de Paulmy, the
minister of war, by the Maréchal de Belle-Isle.

There came, too, information of the energetic efforts being made by
William Pitt in England to complete the conquest of India and America,
the humiliation of France, and the British supremacy of the seas.

This was no idle scheme. Already a formidable fleet and a powerful army
were preparing to besiege Louisbourg under Admiral Boscawen and Major
General Jeffrey Amherst, with Brigadiers Whitmore, Lawrence and James
Wolfe as their able lieutenants.

On June 13th twenty-three vessels of the line, eighteen frigates and
fireships, and 157 transports, bearing about 12,000 troops, left
Halifax and ran before the wind towards the maritime boulevard of
France in America, surnamed the Dunkerque of the new world. On the
frontier of Lake St. Sacrement, Lord Loudon had been replaced by Major
General Abercromby, who with more than six thousand regulars and nine
thousand provincials was to take Carillon and invade Canada by Lake
Champlain and the Richelieu River. Finally Brigadier John Forbes was
organizing an army of six to seven thousand men destined to wrest from
France the Fort Duquesne and the Ohio region.

The last terrible struggle was soon to commence. Montreal was the scene
of much activity. The troops had been moved to Carillon, the district
around Ticonderoga and the frontier of Lake St. Sacrement, but it
was not until June 24th that Montcalm, after a serious conflict with
Vaudreuil, left Montreal to direct the campaign and on June 30th at 3
o'clock in the afternoon arrived at the dilapidated fort of Carillon
with a force of about 3,400 men. On July 1st he had chosen his camp at
Lachute, at the sawmill.[208]

[Illustration: MAP OF MONTREAL, 1758, BEFORE THE CAPITULATION

The City was then bounded: On the north by a stream and marsh, now
marked by Craig Street: on the west by Fortification Lane and upper
part of McGill Street of today; on the east by the Place Viger Station
of today; on the south by the little River St. Pierre and the St.
Lawrence. This plan of the fortifications was published in London by
Thomas Jefferys, geographer to his Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales,
January, 1758.]

Under him were the staff officers whom he brought from France and
with whom Montrealers had become well acquainted. We would desire to
follow this campaign out for this reason, but we must content ourselves
with chronicling how, on July 5th, Abercromby embarked his army of
15,000 men in 900 small boats and 130 whale boats on Lake George
(St. Sacrement), and moved down to Ticonderoga; how on July 6th the
English army disembarked at the head of the rapids; how on the same day
Lord Howe, "the soul of the army," was killed in a skirmish, and how
the great victory of July 8th was due to Montcalm, when the English
retreated, leaving behind them, according to General Abercromby's
account, in killed, wounded and missing, 1,944 officers and men. The
loss of the French, not counting that of Langy's detachment, was but
377.

Montcalm announced the victory thus to his wife: "Without Indians,
almost without Canadian or colony troops--I had only 400--along with
Lévis and Bourlamaque and the troops of the line, 3,100 fighting
men,--I have beaten an army of 25,000 men."[209]

And he wrote to his friend Doreil: "What a day for France! If I had had
two hundred Indians to send out at the head of a thousand picked men,
under the Chevalier de Lévis, not many would have escaped. Ah, my dear
Doreil, what soldiers are ours! Never saw I the like. Why were they not
at Louisbourg?"

On the day of the victory he caused a great cross to be erected on the
battlefield inscribed with these lines, attributing the victory to
Divine interposition:

    "Quid dux! Quid miles! Quid strata ingentia ligna!
    En signum! En victor! Deus hic, Deus ipse triumphat."
    "Soldier and chief and ramparts' strength are nought;
    Behold the conquering cross! 'Tis God the triumph wrought."

It was a famous victory, on the height of Ticonderoga, and no sweeter
name than Carillon falls from a French Canadian's lips to this day.

[Illustration: TICONDEROGA IN 1759]

Once more was Montcalm victorious, but it was to bring him bitter
trouble with Vaudreuil and those surrounding him at Montreal, since
the glory was due to the troops from France. On July 11th, when the
English under Abercromby were in full retreat, M. de Rigaud and several
colonial officers, with a good number of colonials and savages, arrived
at Carillon, to be followed by more than two thousand others, on July
13th.

The object of this manoeuvre of Vaudreuil in sending this tardy
reinforcement seemed to Montcalm and his officers an excuse for
Vaudreuil to complain to the court, that having been reinforced he had
not pursued the English, as the previous year he had not taken Fort
Lydius, being unwilling to complete the victory and so give glory to
the colonial troops. At Montreal feelings ran high and bitter; there
were two camps, those who found fault with every action of the royal
troops, and those who--the ladies especially--saw in the delay in
sending the reinforcement a desire to abandon the poor battalions to
the enemy.

At Carillon the colonial troops could not hide their chagrin and
jealousy at not having participated more fully in the victory of the
8th of July, nor could the French regulars on their part dissimulate
their satisfaction at having won the battle almost without Canadian
"colony troops." Again the two hostile prejudices were in evidence and
manifested themselves even in the letters of their leaders, Montcalm
from Carillon, and Vaudreuil from Montreal, to the minister of war.

This acrimonious rivalry which existed between the higher military
officers and the Canadian officers and functionaries, though not so
largely shared by the soldiers and common people, who for the most part
maintained good relations amongst themselves, is a mark of this unhappy
period, and must be mentioned if we are to present a true picture of
Montreal as the headquarters of military life of this period.

An epistolary duel was carried on from Montreal and Carillon veiled in
the language of courtesy, but none the less bitter. In justification
of the uselessness of pursuing the enemy, Montcalm relied on the
experience of the men on the spot, while Vaudreuil, seated in his
bureau at Montreal, "believed himself in a position at a distance of
fifty leagues to determine war operations in a country he has never
seen, and where the best generals would be embarrassed even after
having seen it."

There are few generals who can so conduct campaigns. Von Moltke was
one, Vaudreuil was not another; nor was his secretary.

Montcalm in his letters to the governor saw the hand of an enemy--that
of the governor's secretary, Grasset de Saint-Sauveur.[210]

The author of the "Mémoires du Canada (Mémoires et réflections
politiques et militaires sur la guerre du Canada depuis 1756 jusqu'à
1760)," says of this secretary: "M. de la Jonquière has placed too
much confidence, as he explained himself, in a secretary named
Saint-Sauveur. For this man, without honour and without sentiment, has
employed all means, licit or illicit, to make his fortune. He asked and
obtained from his master the exclusive right to sell _eau de vie_ to
the Indians. From that moment he attracted public enmity as well as did
his master, who was said to be a half partner in the proceeds of
the traffic." At the end of the same "Mémoire," speaking of the
functionaries who remained in Canada in 1760 the author writes again:
"Saint-Sauveur, the governor's secretary, has remained also. I have had
the pleasure of hearing the English governor, Murray, speak in 1759 of
this man, saying that he desired this man to fall into his hands; that
if France, or rather the French government, had tolerated vice in this
man, he wished to correct him; that he was a traitor to his master;
that he had abused the confidence given him; that they only saw in
him cheating (_friponnerie_) and illicit trading; that he himself was
grieved at the blindness of this general (Vaudreuil). It is doubtful
whether this man dare cross over into France. It is an established fact
that he is worth more than 1,200,000 _livres_."

With a view of a reconciliation, on August 7th Montcalm sent
Bougainville from Carillon to the governor of Montreal to make personal
explanations, and on the 13th the _aide-de-camp_ returned. We learn
the success of his mission from his letter written to the minister of
war on August 10th: "Union appears to me today perfectly established
in good faith between our chiefs." In his journal on his return to
Carillon he writes of his impressions and his delicate mission at
Montreal: "I have been sent by the Marquis of Montcalm to the Marquis
de Vaudreuil with the order to stifle, if possible, this leaven of
discord which is being fermented and which perhaps may have been
hurtful to the good of the service. Thus our general still makes the
advances. Public interest is the rule of his conduct and he has acted
ceaselessly in the spirit of the words of Themistocles, 'Strike! But
hear!' It appears that the Marquis de Vaudreuil in all his bickerings
has followed the impressions of subalterns interested in creating
variances, rather than his own ideas. What is, however, his own is his
'amour propre' and a jealousy of a rival--a foundation on which the
mischief makers readily build. The appearances are that my journey has
not been unfruitful. I hope that facts will prove it so."

Meanwhile Montcalm remained at Carillon, holding the position so as
effectively to prevent any return of the English. On September 1st a
courier came from Montreal with news that the English were on Lake
Ontario and had arrived within three leagues of Fort Frontenac. This
was followed shortly by the news of the fall of Louisbourg. This latter
was at first discredited by Montcalm, but the entry in his journal,
at once heartbreaking and laconic, tells its own tale: "September 6,
1758--News from Quebec announcing the capture of Louisbourg; from
Montreal, that of Frontenac."

That night Montcalm left Carillon secretly with Pontleroy and
Bougainville, called by Vaudreuil to consult on the critical
conjuncture in which the French possessions in America were now placed.

Never since the beginning of the "Seven Years' War" was the situation
so menacing for the colony. With the loss of Frontenac, the French were
no longer masters of Lake Ontario; Niagara was in a perilous position
and French prestige had suffered a mortal blow in the regions of the
Great Lakes. With the capture of Louisbourg, the English held the
gateway of Canada. Their return to Lake Ontario and the destruction of
Frontenac would open to them the route of the higher reaches of the St.
Lawrence, onward to Montreal.

Montreal was reached on September 6th and Montcalm stayed there four
days. During that time he drew up for Vaudreuil three "mémoires," one
on the defence of the frontier of Lake Ontario, another on that of Lake
Champlain, and a third on the defence of Quebec, as well as on general
operations and regulations. These, in spite of the apparent cessation
of personal hostilities, and the renewal of courtesies, seem to have
displeased Vaudreuil. The latter "mémoire" on the reorganization
of the army and the future methods of conducting war in Canada was
looked upon by Vaudreuil and his secretary as a personal offence.
In his letter of November 1st to the minister of marine, Vaudreuil
calls to his attention "the faults of this 'mémoire,' the passion
with which it is treated, the desire to censure the government, the
desire of innovation, and more particularly that of lording it over the
colonists."

The Montreal clique saw in the frank attempt of Montcalm to solve the
situation another depreciation of the colonial forces.

While in Montreal it was arranged, with Vaudreuil's consent, that
Bougainville should be sent to France at the end of the campaign to
expose the Canadian situation to the king.

On September 13th Montcalm was on his way back to Carillon. But the
enemy never returned. At the end of October news arrived that the
English had broken up their camp at William Henry and had left Lake St.
Sacrement. On November 4th, leaving behind at Carillon a garrison of
400 men, Montcalm left Montreal with the Languedoc battalion, which was
soon to be followed by the other battalions. The war of 1758 was over.

The rigorous winter season set in very early this year and the return
to Montreal from Carillon was a painful journey to Montcalm and his
troops. A disastrous wind on Lake Champlain separated the vessels and
nigh foundered several. The cold was intense and the last vessels found
themselves hampered by the ice. Yet the victorious general reached St.
John without harm. "I will venture to say," he wrote to Bourlamaque,
"that my vessels carry Caesar and his fortunes."

On November 9th he reached Montreal. Then started the work of
distributing the troops for winter quarters, many of them being
stationed round about the Montreal district. The battalion of La Sarre
was stationed on the Ile Jésus, Lachenaie, Terrebonne, Mascouche
and l'Assomption; the royal Roussillons at La Prairie, Longueuil,
Boucherville, Varennes and Verchères; that of Languedoc, in the
governmental district of Three Rivers, from Ste. Anne to Batiscan; that
of Guyenne, at Contrecoeur, the River Chambly, St. Ours, Sorel; the
first battalion of the Berry regiment in the Beaupré district, and the
second on the Ile d'Orleans; and that of Béarn at Sault-au-Récollet,
Longue Pointe, Pointe aux Trembles, the Rivière des Prairies, St.
Sulpice, La Valtrie and Repentigny.

In Montreal Montcalm's first care was to make representations to the
governor and the Intendant Bigot, of the insufficient salary of the
soldiers and the officers especially, owing to the high cost of living.
In his journal Montcalm gives a comparative table of the tariffs of
1758, 1755, and 1743. For example, in 1743 a sheep cost four _livres_;
in 1755, ten; and in 1758, forty. In 1753 a pound of pork cost three
_sous_, ten in 1755, one _livre_ and ten _sous_ in 1758. In 1743 a
pound of butter cost five _sous_; twelve _sous_ in 1755, and forty
_sous_ in 1758.

This application brought a supplementary payment of forty-five _livres_
a month to the captains, and thirty to the lieutenants. Yet it must
be added that the officers affected much disedifying ostentation and
magnificence in their high rate of living, and many abused the facility
they had of borrowing money. On November 12th de Bougainville and M. de
Doreil, of the commissary department, were sent as representatives to
the court to tell of the condition of affairs in Canada. The governor,
Vaudreuil, somewhat distrusted these as friends of Montcalm but he
had an ally in Péan, who had left as early as August 13th, with warm
recommendations. The ostensible purpose of the adjutant major of Quebec
was to take the waters at Barèges for the cure of a wounded arm, but
M. Doreil, writing to the minister in the same month and warning him
that Péan was one of the chief causes of the maladministration of the
colony, suggests that he was anxious to clear away with his fortune
of 2,000,000, which he had rapidly amassed. "I have not dared to say
4,000,000, although according to public report I could have done so."

The mails to France and the favourable envoys bore Montcalm's urgent
demand for peace, peace, peace at any price to meet the contingencies
of the hour. Montcalm had no illusions; he foresaw final disaster
owing to the weakness of the mother country, worn out by the European
war, and to the supremacy of the English force by sea which would
effectively cut off all supplies and reinforcements, could they be
sent. Yet he did not despair, but prepared to meet the imminent
invasion should peace not be declared. His letters to his family reveal
a secret presentiment that he might never again see his dear Candiac or
Montpellier.

Montcalm remained in Montreal till December 22d. His letters to
Bourlamaque show that he spent the time intervening in a very quiet
manner, going out little, reading much and finding the days very long.
He read with interest the "Dictionnaire Encyclopédique," then in all
its novelty and vogue. This vast literary, philosophic and scientific
enterprise, which was to have such an effect on French thought,
pernicious in its skepticism and anti-religious spirit, had been
interdicted in 1752 after the publication of the first two volumes; but
on its resumption by 1758 it had already given forth eight volumes.
Montcalm wrote to Bourlamaque that he was skipping over the articles he
did not wish to know about, and leaving those he could not understand.

Montcalm spent January and February amid the gayeties of Quebec and
the pleasant company of the _Rue du Parloir_, which appealed to him so
strongly. His correspondence with his lieutenant gives us an insight
into the causes leading to the impending ruin which he foresaw surely
stealing onward. He was not happy; he had a presentiment of the
brooding catastrophe and foresaw the supreme crisis. Thus he wrote of
January 4, 1759: "A ball on Sunday. Peace, or all will go wrong; 1759
will be worse than 1758. Ah! how black I see things!" Another day: "The
colony is lost if peace does not come. I see nothing that can save her.
Those who govern it have serious cause to reproach themselves. I have
none for myself."

Again: "Pleasures at Quebec have been most keenly pursued in spite of
the prevailing misery and the approaching loss of the colony. There
have never been so many balls, nor such heavy games of chance in spite
of the prohibition of last year. The governor general and the intendant
have authorized it."

In March, Montcalm was again in the more sober atmosphere of Montreal,
preparing military memoirs, and reading, according to his letter to
Bourlamaque, in the third volume of the Encyclopedia, "the beautiful
articles on Christianity, citation, comedy, comic, college, council,
colony, commerce, etc." He was also preparing his letters for France.
In a letter dated April 12, 1759, to the minister of war, the Maréchal
de Belle-Isle, he threw away all reserve and decided to tell all he saw
and knew, thus to expose in its heartbreaking reality the desperate
state of the colony, to lay bare the plagues that were gnawing it, the
corruption and the depredations which were conspiring with the English
invasions to precipitate its downfall. "Except for an unexpected good
fortune," he wrote, "of a great diversion into the English colonies
by sea, or of great mistakes on the side of the enemy, Canada will be
taken this campaign or certainly next.

"The English have sixty thousand men, we at most ten thousand to eleven
thousand. Our government has no money. Advance pay and provisions are
wanting. In default of these the English will win. The fields are
uncultivated. We need cattle. The Canadians are discouraged. There
is no confidence in M. de Vaudreuil or in M. Bigot. M. de Vaudreuil
is in no position to direct a war campaign. He is inactive; he gives
his confidence to experimenters rather than to the general sent from
France. M. Bigot appears to be engaged only in making a great fortune
for himself, his adherents and hangers-on. Avarice has obtained the
master hand. The officers, the government storekeepers and clerks, ...
are making astounding fortunes.... The expenses which have been paid at
Quebec by the treasurer of the colony reach twenty-four millions; the
year before they were only twelve to thirteen millions. This year they
will mount up to thirty-six millions. It seems that all are hurrying to
make their fortunes before the loss of the colony, which many perhaps
desire as an impenetrable veil to hide their bad conduct."

He then enumerates particular instances of glaring acts of "grafting"
and illicit trading. For example: "Is it necessary to transport the
artillery, gun carriages, wagons and utensils? M. Mercier, who commands
the artillery, is the contractor under different names; everything
is done badly and dearly; this officer, who came as a simple soldier
twenty years ago, will soon become rich to the amount of about six
hundred thousand or seven hundred thousand _livres_, perhaps a million
if this lasts. I have often spoken of this to M. de Vaudreuil or to M.
Bigot. Each one throws the fault onto his colleague."

"The people," he continues, "frightened by these expenses, fear a
deterioration in the value of the paper money of the country; a bad
effect follows--the cost of living increases. The Canadians who have
not taken part in illicit profits hate the government.... Even should
peace come, the colony is ruined if the whole government is not
changed." Thus he wrote to his responsible chief in France.

In his journal he is naturally fuller in his condemnations and he
remarks: "One would need to have the pen always in hand to write down
all these 'friponneries.' O! tempora! O mores!"

This season was a painful one for him; he laments over the present and
the future. "Pauvre roi! Pauvre France! Cara patria!" In another letter
to Bourlamaque he surveys his own position: "In a short time I shall
be forty-seven years of age. The dignity of a marshal of France would
flatter me as well as any other man; it would be fine to have it in six
years, but to buy it by this kind of life would be at too dear a price."

In his journal he unburdens himself more fully. "O, king, worthy of
being better served," he writes. "Dear fatherland, crushed with taxes,
to enrich cheats and greedy ones!... Shall I keep my innocence as I
have done up to the present, in the midst of corruption? I shall have
defended the colony; I shall have owed 10,000 écus; but I shall see
men enriching themselves like a Ralig, a Coban, a Cécile, a set of men
without faith, rascals interested in the provision enterprise, gaining
in one year four or five hundred thousand _livres_, arising from their
outrageous expenditures; a Maurin, a clerk at 100 crowns, an abortion
by nature, a snail in figure, traveling with a suite of calèches and
carriages, spending more in conveyances, harness and in horses than a
young coxcomb and giddy-headed farmer-general of revenues. And this
uphold of provisions, an enterprise formed since the time of M. de la
Porte, who went shares in it! Will France never produce an enlightened
head of its marine department, a reformer of abuses? The peculations of
a Verres, of a Marius, of which Juvenal speaks, do not come near these."

When not otherwise engaged in his literary and military studies--for
social life seems to have been not very attractive to him in
Montreal--Montcalm would confer with the governor, with whom the
appearance of courtesy at least was preserved, though at times with
underlying mutual antipathies. On one occasion he entered the office of
Vaudreuil, whom he surprised listening indulgently to M. d'Eschambault,
his nephew by marriage, inveighing against the French officers,
accusing them of insubordinate speech against the authorities after
the unfortunate events following Carillon. Caught in the act, the
governor, flushing up, took the opportunity to complain bitterly of the
French officers. Montcalm profited by the occasion also to unburden his
heart on the subject of all the unworthy hawking of tittle-tattle and
exaggerations productive of harm to the service, and he dealt "a long
and strong, but respectful" lesson to both of them. "I should trust,"
wrote Montcalm to Bourlamaque, "that this will correct tale-bearers and
those who listen to them."

Another incident related to Bourlamaque also gives a picture of the
strained relations of the two military factions in Montreal. One day,
in the governor's office, an officer of the colonial militia saw fit
to say in the presence of Vaudreuil, Montcalm and others, that during
the siege of William Henry, General Webb had great fear at Fort Lydius,
that Orange and New York were without troops, and that this fort
could have been easily taken. This being a favourite topic with the
governor, he commented on it with eagerness. Stung to the quick by this
recurrence to an old sore, Montcalm gave anew the reasons which had
prevented him making the second siege in 1757, adding that it was no
use feeding still on chimeras. "I concluded, by saying modestly, that
I did my best at the seat of war, following my feeble lights, and that
if he was not satisfied with his second in command, he had better make
the campaign in person, so as to carry out his own ideas. The tears
sprang to his eyes and he muttered between his teeth that such might be
the case. The conversation finished on my part by saying: 'I shall be
delighted and I shall willingly serve under you.'

"Madame de Vaudreuil wished to intervene. 'Madame,' I said, 'permit
me, without departing from the respect due to you, to have the honour
to tell you that ladies ought not to mix in war affairs.' Madame again
wished to interrupt. 'Madame,' I said, 'without departing from the
respect due to you, allow me to have the honour to inform you that if
Madame de Montcalm were here and heard us speaking of war affairs with
M. le Marquis de Vaudreuil, she would maintain silence.'"

"This scene, before his officers, three of them colonials, will be
embroidered and reimbroidered; but here it is."

CHAPTER XLII

1759

THE FALL OF QUEBEC

MONTREAL THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT

     THE SPRING ICE SHOVE--NEWS FROM FRANCE--MILITARY HONOURS SENT BUT
     POOR REINFORCEMENTS--PROJECTED FRENCH INVASION OF ENGLAND--GLOOM
     IN CANADA--THE MONTREAL MILITIA AT THE SIEGE OF QUEBEC--FALL OF
     QUEBEC, MONTREAL SEAT OF GOVERNMENT--THE WINTER ATTEMPT TO REGAIN
     QUEBEC--THE EXPECTED FRENCH FLEET NEVER ARRIVES--RETREAT OF FRENCH
     TO MONTREAL.


At the commencement of April, the violent breaking up of the ice of the
St. Lawrence proclaimed that spring had arrived. "It was a sight," said
Montcalm, "to see the masses of ice heaping up, mountain-like, amidst
great noise. The ice shove took place at 7.30 A. M. It happens from
time to time and makes one fear for a part of Montreal, which is built
too near the river. One year it bore down all the walls of the town.
This year it has battered the Château de Callières, a house at the
extremity of the town, so called, because it was the dwelling of the
governor general of that name."

The troops began to be moved. At last the vessels from France reached
Quebec and Bougainville returned to Montreal on May 14th to render
his report to the governor general, confirming his letters, arriving
ahead. The situation now unfolded by Bougainville, with the letters
from the court at Versailles and the ministers of war and marine to
Vaudreuil and Montcalm, was one of intense anxiety. France was in a
pitiable state of degeneracy. A weak king sat without honour on its
throne, surrounded by ministers without pride and without patriotism,
sad successors of a Henry IV, a Richelieu, a Louis XIV and a Colbert.
There was no consistent policy in the king's council. The king, who had
boasted "_après moi, le déluge_," was a nobody, and Madame la Marquise
de Pompadour virtually prime minister, all powerful. There was no
credit. The finances were inadequate to pay for the toilettes and the
shameful splendours of the Pompadour, whose budget was greater than
that of Canada under the infamous government of Louis XV. France saw
its erstwhile moral and political grandeur in decay; its administration
of its foreign and home affairs a by-word heightened by the scandalous
disorders of the court of a king who was a gamester and a high liver.

It is no wonder then that Bougainville, after three months' insistent
solicitations in France with M. Berryer, the minister of marine,
the Marshal de Belle-Isle and the Pompadour, could only obtain the
reinforcement for Canada of 400 men and some ammunition, and inadequate
supplies of provisions. In his journal he notes that "M. Berryer who,
from being a lieutenant of the police in Paris, had been made minister
of marine, would not understand that Canada was the barrier of our
other colonies and that the English would not attack any others until
they had chased us out of it. This minister was fond of proverbs and he
told me pertinently that one did not seek to save the stables when the
house was on fire." Hence the small reinforcements for the stables of
Canada.

Honours, however, were thickly scattered. Montcalm had been made a
lieutenant-general, with an increase of salary, with the red ribbon of
knighthood of the Order of St. Louis; de Lévis became a maréchal de
camp; Bourlamaque had been created a brigadier, Bougainville a colonel,
and both had received supplementary pensions; M. de Vaudreuil was named
Grand Croix of the Order of St. Louis; M. de Rigaud, his brother,
received for life the concession of the Port of Baie Verte (Green Bay).
Many other officers received pensions, promotions or the Cross of St.
Louis.

Without the necessary reinforcements the colony appeared abandoned.
The argument given for this to Vaudreuil and Bigot in a letter dated
February 3d from the minister of marine was that "the continuation of
the war in Europe, the too great risks by sea and the necessity of
reuniting the naval forces, did not allow of their separation or the
hazarding of a part of them to afford the uncertain succour which would
be employed more usefully for the state and the relief of Canada, in
expeditions more prompt and decisive later."

Yet in spite of the news that the English counted on invading Carillon
and Quebec--Amherst at Carillon and Wolfe at Quebec--Montcalm's
instructions were "to hearken to no capitulation, but to defend
himself foot by foot, and not to imitate the shameful conduct of
Louisbourg."[211] Vaudreuil had to keep his foot in Canada at any price.
The letter of M. Berryer to Montcalm and Vaudreuil, dated February 10,
1759, put this explicitly: "Your principal object, which you ought not
to lose sight of, must be to preserve at least a sufficient portion
of this colony and to hold it, in view of recovering the whole on the
declaration of peace, it being a very different thing, in a treaty to
stipulate for the restitution of the whole of a colony, than for that
only of dependent portions lost in the hazard of war.... Moreover, His
Majesty will not lose sight of you during this campaign.... He will
busy himself about means to assist you effectively, not only through
the new reinforcements he may send you, but still more by efficient
manoeuvres to procure diversions of the strength likely otherwise to
oppose you."

This enigmatic, mysterious allusion, not then understood, was to
nothing less than to the projected invasion of England which, it was
thought, would withdraw the English forces from Canada. This plan,
conceived by M. Machault, prompted by the Maréchal de Belle-Isle and
enthusiastically adopted by Choiseul, forty-six years before Napoleon,
was actually attempted. But Pitt, becoming aware of the preparations,
quickly encircled the British Isles and Ireland with a powerful fleet
and organized the militia forces on land, and sent Rodney, Boscawen
and Hawke to attack the French fleets when mobilizing. Lavisse, in the
"Histoire de France," 8, II, p. 219, tells the result: "The Atlantic
fleet was rendered as powerless as was that of the Mediterranean with
the loss to France of twenty-nine vessels of the line and thirty-five
frigates; its fleet was reduced to nearly nothing. It was no longer in
the position to defend its colonies."[212]

It was a gloomy lookout for the military authorities at Montreal.
To them it seemed as if the government at home, unmindful of the
sacrifice of its heroes in Canada by field, flood and ice, was ready to
abandon the "few _arpents_ of snow" as too great a burden for its weak
shoulders and to shamefully lower the _fleur-de-lys_ to the flag of
England.[214]

The forces at the disposal of Canada were, according to the census
taken in January, only 15,229. The census of February, 1759, gave a
total population in Canada of 82,000, with 20,000 able to bear arms.
(Cf., Rameau, "La France aux Colonies," p. 86.) This would not include
the regular army and the domiciliated Indians.

Smith, in his "History of Canada," states that "when the government
wanted the services of the militia as soldiers, the colonel of
militia, or the town major, in consequence of a requisition from the
governor general, sent orders to the several captains of militia in
the country parishes to furnish a certain number of militiamen, chosen
by those officers, who ordered the drafts into town under an escort
commanded by an officer of militia, who conducted them to the town
major, where they were each furnished with a gun, a capot, a Canadian
cloak, a breechclout, a cotton shirt, a cap, a pair of leggings, a
pair of Indian shoes and a blanket; after which they were marched to
the garrison for which they were destined. The militia were generally
reviewed once or twice a year to inspect their arms."

They acted as bushrangers and would march with the French regulars to
the tune of "Malbrouk s'en va-t'en guerre."

To these had been communicated, by Vaudreuil, the king's order to fight
even to extinction, and the governor general, to his honour, added:
"For my part, I am determined to consent to no capitulation, convinced
of its dangerous consequences for all the Canadians. The thing is so
certain that it would be incomparably sweeter for them, their wives and
their children, to be buried under the ruins of the colony."

With these few but resolute troops Canada had now to defend herself,
attacked at three points--Quebec, Carillon and Niagara--against
overwhelming odds. Quebec was the first objective of attack by the
English, and on May 21st Montcalm left Montreal to put it in a
position, as far as it was possible, to stand the siege. On May 24th
he was joined by Vaudreuil. The story of the siege of Quebec, which
lasted two months and twelve days--from July 6th to September 18th--is
foreign to our purpose; but we must know that the militia of the town
of Montreal, to the number of 1,150, acquitted themselves honourably on
that heroic occasion. On September 13th Quebec dates its fall. It was
the fatal day of the disaster on the Plains of Abraham, where Montcalm,
bearing his death wound, was led on his horse by three soldiers by the
St. Louis gate to the city. At 5 o'clock on the morning of September
14th he breathed his last like a Christian hero, believing in the
promises of immortality. Wolfe also had met his fate in the same
engagement.[215]

[Illustration: WOLFE AND MONTCALM MONUMENT, QUEBEC

One of the few instances known in which a monument has been erected to
two opposing generals.]

[Illustration: MONTCALM STATUE]

[Illustration: WOLFE STATUE]

On October 18th the English fleet left Quebec. The town was desolate.
After the death of Wolfe, Monckton put Murray in command of the
garrison, with twenty gunships. Brigadier General Murray remained there
with 7,300 men, at once governor and commander in chief. Lord Townshend
and Admiral Saunders, with the rest of the fleet, returned to England
with the embalmed body of Wolfe.

The City of Champlain was in other hands. It is attributed to Madame
de Pompadour that on receipt of the news she uttered the frivolous
comment, "At last, the king will sleep in peace." By Louis XV, this
new wound to French national pride was received with indifference.
Already beaten at Rosbach, Crevelt and Meudon, what mattered another
loss so far away? Nevertheless he sent, at the entreaty of Vaudreuil,
inadequate forces, which the English fleet never allowed to reach their
destination.

The loss of Quebec was looked upon by the English, at home and in
America, as the virtual conquest of Canada. England rejoiced with
bonfire celebrations and the New England pulpits resounded with the
oratory of thanksgiving for the conquest. France received the news with
pain, but with no surprise. Patriotism was dead and there was little
talk of sending a strong reinforcement. The ministers were content with
sending 400 men, with three or four vessels loaded with provisions and
warlike stores, and convoyed by a frigate.[216] Yet the Canadians did
not despair. With indomitable courage, and buoyed up perhaps by the
hope that some big scheme for their succour was being devised in Paris,
they held to their policy under General de Lévis, now in command, of
disputing the position foot by foot. With the loss of the capital,
Montreal became the seat of civil and religious governments, as well as
the military headquarters. By the end of 1759 it was a small remnant
that now remained to the French--the narrow strip of territory on the
St. Lawrence from Jacques Cartier and Kingston, Montreal and Ile aux
Noix being the only posts of importance still to be reduced.

During the winter of 1759-60, while petty hostilities were kept up with
the enemy to divert their attention, busy preparations were being made
in Montreal to advance to the recapture of Quebec at the breaking up of
the ice. The historian, Parkman, in his "Montcalm and Wolfe," Vol. II,
Ch. 29, thus describes this period:

"The difficulty was to find means of transportation. The depth of
the snow and the want of draught animals made it necessary to wait
till the river became navigable; but preparation was begun at once.
Lévis was the soul of the enterprise. Provisions were gathered from
afar and near; cannon, mortars and munitions of war were brought from
the frontier posts, and butcher knives weritted to the muzzles of
guns to serve the Canadians in place of bayonets. All the working men
about Montreal were busied in making tools and gun carriages. Stores
were impressed from the merchants; and certain articles which could
not otherwise be had, were smuggled, with extraordinary address, out
of Quebec itself. Early in spring the militia received orders to
muster for the march. There were doubts and discontent, 'but,' says a
contemporary, 'sensible people dared not speak, for if they did they
were set down as English.' Some there were who in secret called the
scheme 'Lévis' folly.' Yet it was perfectly rational, well conceived
and conducted with vigour and skill. Two frigates, two sloops of war
and a number of smaller craft still remained in the river, under the
command of Vauquelin, the brave officer who had distinguished himself
at the siege of Louisbourg. The stores and cannon were placed on board
these vessels and the army embarked in a fleet of bateaux, and on the
20th of April the whole set out together for the scene of action. They
comprised eight battalions of troops of the line and two of colony
troops, with the colonial artillery, 3,000 Canadians and 400 Indians.
When they left Montreal, their effective strength, besides Indians,
is said by Lévis to have been 6,910, a number which was increased as
they advanced by the garrisons of Jacques Cartier, Deschambault and
Pointe aux Trembles, as well as by the Canadians on both sides of
the St. Lawrence below Three Rivers, for Vaudreuil had ordered the
militia captains to join his standard with all their followers, armed
and equipped, on pain of death. (Vaudreuil aux Capitaines de Milice,
16 avril 1760.) These accessions appear to have raised his force to
between eight and nine thousand."

The story of the journey to Quebec, of the Battle of St. Foy and the
second battle on the Plains of Abraham, although engrossing in its
interest, takes us too far afield. Suffice it to say that the siege of
Quebec was raised by the French during the night of May 16-17, after a
short but brave campaign. Then followed their retreat.

The victory would have been with them if the expected fleet from France
had arrived. The moment was critical; each side was scanning the St.
Lawrence for their countries' flags, the red for England and the white
for France. The British frigate Lowestoffe was the first to arrive
on May 9th, to be followed a week later by the ship of the line,
Vanguard, and the frigate, Diana. These latter arrived in the harbour
on the evening of the 15th and on the next morning passed the town to
attack Vauquelin's fleet in the river above, with the result of their
destruction and the loss of the stores of food and ammunition.[217]

The little French fleet never arrived. They had run into the Baie des
Chaleurs to escape from pursuing enemies. There they were found, and
the frigate and the four vessels convoyed by it were burned by Captain
Byron, then cruising with a powerful fleet in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
France was responsible for her delay and niggardliness in succouring
her own.

     CONDITIONS--FORMAL POSSESSION OF TOWN BY THE BRITISH--THE END OF
     THE FRENCH REGIME.


After the retreat from Quebec, de Lévis made preparations for the last
stand at Montreal. Along the trail, posts were stationed: Rochebeaucour
with 300 men at Pointe aux Trembles; Repentigny with 200 at Jacques
Cartier; Dumas with 1,200 at Deschambault; Bougainville at Ile aux
Noix to bar the approach from Lake Champlain, and La Corne to defend
the rapids above Montreal. Each of these points was important, as the
plan of campaign of the English, organized by Amherst, was to descend
to Montreal, the remaining stronghold of the French, by three routes
simultaneously--east, west and south--and uniting there at the same
time, to invest it with an army of 16,000 and to take it as an easy
prey, for its weaknesses were known. Maps were not wanting of it. It
was known that its fortifications, made for defence against the Indians
alone, could not resist English cannon.

From three widely separated points, three armies were surely and with
deadly certainty moving on Montreal. Murray was to ascend the St.
Lawrence from Quebec, Brigadier Haviland to force his entrance by way
of Lake Champlain, while Amherst was to lead the main army to Montreal,
down the St. Lawrence from Lake Ontario. The latter, though the more
difficult journey to execute, the rapids being numerous, was undertaken
to prevent the French from attempting to escape up-country, and so
defer the inevitable day of their humiliation.

At Montreal the governor general, Vaudreuil, waited for the inevitable,
but with dogged resistance and hope till the last. "At this time," he
wrote to the minister, "I am taking the most just measure to unite
our forces, and if our situation permits, fight a battle or several
battles. It is to be feared that we shall go down before an enemy so
numerous and strong; but whatever may be the event, we shall save
the honour of the king's arms. I have the honour to repeat to you,
Monseigneur, that if any resource were left me, whatever progress
the English might make, I would maintain myself in some part of
the colony with my remaining troops, after having fought with the
greatest obstinacy; but I am absolutely without the least remnant of
the necessary means. In these unhappy circumstances I shall continue
to use every manoeuvre and device to keep the enemy in check; but if
we succumb in the battles we shall fight, I shall apply myself to
obtaining a capitulation which may avert the total ruin of a people who
will remain forever French, and who could not survive their misfortunes
but for the hope of being restored by the treaty of peace to the rule
of His Most Christian Majesty."

If we follow the route of each of the armies whose objective was
Montreal, we shall find them making easy progress, for the country was
ripe for the change of government. The militia, seeing the colony was
lost to France, gave up their arms, as did the regulars, famished and
despairing. The greatest cause of despair in the old régime now passing
away was the news that not only the home government could not send
military succour, but that the royal treasury could not meet colonial
bills, the payment of which was now suspended for a time. The people
had advanced much money to the government and now they found their
paper money almost valueless and discredited.

Vaudreuil and Bigot at Montreal were informed of this deferred payment
by an official circular, in which "they were assured, however, that the
exchequer bills (_letters de change_), drawn in 1757 and 1758, would
be paid in three months after the anticipated peace, with interest;
that those drawn in 1759 would be discharged in like manner, eighteen
months after peace; and as for the intendant's promissory notes
(_ordonnances_), they would be liquidated as soon as convenient. This
news startled those concerned like a thunderbolt; there was owing by
France to the colonials more than forty million francs (say 1,600,000
pounds sterling), and there was scarcely any one of them who was not a
creditor of the state." (Bell's translation of Garneau's "History of
Canada," Vol. II, p. 201.)

Murray began his advance on Montreal on July 14th and ascended the
St. Lawrence with 2,200 men, convoyed by three frigates and twelve
gunboats, carrying twenty-four 18 and 12-pounders. With the bateaux
they amounted to thirty-five vessels. Later in the journey, these
were joined by some thirteen hundred men under Lord Rollo, arriving
from Louisbourg. On August 4th the fleet was in sight of Three
Rivers. Beyond some skirmishes along the banks, the progress had been
triumphant, notwithstanding the elaborate preparations made by de Lévis
to prevent its advance. The habitants, previously warned, on July 13th,
to remain quietly in their homes offered little resistance, but for
the most part accepted the oath of allegiance or at least neutrality.
This done, they gladly enough sold their eggs and farm produce. Three
Rivers was passed on August 5th. No attack was made on the French
garrison, "because," says Knox, the soldier historian, who was with
Murray, "a delay here would be absurd, as that wretched place must
share the fate of Montreal. Our fleet sailed this morning. The French
troops, apparently two thousand, lined their different works and were,
in general, clothed as regulars, except a very few Canadians and about
fifty Picts, or savages, their bodies being painted of a reddish
colour and their faces of different colours, which I plainly discerned
with my glass.

"Their light cavalry, which paraded along shore, seemed to be well
appointed, clothed in blue faced with scarlet, but their officers
had white uniforms. In fine, their troops, batteries, fair-looking
houses; their situation on the banks of a delightful river; our fleet
sailing triumphantly before them, with our floating batteries drawn up
in line of battle; the country on both sides interspersed with neat
settlements, together with the verdure of the fields and trees and the
clear, pleasant weather, afforded as agreeable a prospect as the most
lively imagination can conceive." (Knox, II.)

As the fleet advanced among the Islands of St. Peter, the writer had
new material for his picturesque pen. "I think nothing could equal
the beauties of our navigation this morning; the meandering course of
the narrow channel; the awfulness and solemnity of the dark forests
with which these islands are covered; the fragrancy of the spontaneous
fruits, shrubs and flowers; the verdure of the water by the reflection
of the neighbouring woods; the wild chirping notes of the feathered
inhabitants; the masts and sails of ships appearing as if among the
trees, both ahead and astern, formed together an enchanting diversity."

On August 12th the British were before Sorel. Hither Bourlamaque had
come and had intrenched two or three thousand troops and militia
along the strand, while Dumas, with another body, was on the northern
shore. His object, and that of de Lévis, was to prevent the juncture
of Haviland's force, reported to be coming from Lake Champlain by the
Richelieu River, at its mouth at Sorel, with Murray's force. The one
hope of the French was to be able to attack, in detail, each of the
three portions of the advancing army, for once these united, there was
no hope of success. Murray fired on Sorel. It was quickly deserted, the
inhabitants joining Bourlamaque. On landing Murray burned a settlement
near Sorel as a lesson, following on his proclamation advising the
habitants to remain quietly at home and not engage as combatants, for
fear of retribution to follow. "I was under the cruel necessity of
burning the greatest part of these poor unhappy people's houses," he
wrote to Pitt on August 24, 1760. "I pray God this example may suffice,
for my nature revolts when this becomes a necessary part of my duty."
The effect was immediate, for, in spite of counter proclamations
of Vaudreuil from Montreal, before the end of the month, half of
Bourlamaque's army gave in their allegiance.

On the 24th of August Murray's fleet reached Contrecoeur, about
eighteen miles east of the Island of Montreal, and there he waited
until he could communicate with Haviland and Amherst.

Meanwhile Haviland's force from Lake Champlain was advancing to
Montreal with uninterrupted success. On August 16th he had left Crown
Point with 3,400 regulars, provincials and Indians, convoyed by one
brig, three sloops and four floating stages bearing the artillery. It
had been hoped that there was a good chance to stop this advance and
for this reason Bougainville, with 1,700 men, had been stationed at Ile
aux Noix. By the 21st the English force had passed around the east of
the island and had constructed batteries, from which shells were thrown
into the defences. By the 26th Bougainville was compelled to realize
that the port could not be held. Accordingly he left the garrison
of fifty men, of wounded and invalids, with orders to surrender on
the 28th. On the 27th he landed above the fort on the west bank
unobserved, and passing through the woods, joined Roquemaure at St.
Johns in safety, twelve miles below. Next day the surrender of Ile aux
Noix took place. Haviland followed on to St. Johns and Chambly, driving
Bougainville and Roquemaure to join Bourlamaque on the St. Lawrence.
Now came fresh desertions from the Canadian ranks and new oaths of
allegiance. Haviland desirous to get in touch with Murray's army sent
Rogers, of the Rangers, to announce his arrival. But it was not until
September 6th that Rogers was able to reach Colonel Haldimand at the
head of the light infantry and grenadiers.

Meanwhile, Haldimand crossed the country to Longueuil, opposite
Montreal, and encamped immediately opposite Murray's forces on
September 6th.

The main body of the English army under Amherst, 10,170 strong,
including 760 Indians under Sir William Johnson, had meanwhile
proceeded by the Mohawk River and Oneida Lake to Oswego. The story of
its descent to Montreal may be told by Parkman.[218]

"The army of Amherst had gathered at Oswego in July. On the 10th of
August it was all afloat on Lake Ontario, to the number 10,147 men,
besides about seven hundred Indians under Sir William Johnson. Before
the 15th, the whole had reached 'La Présentation,' otherwise called
Oswegatchie, or La Galette, the seat of Father Piquet's mission. Nearby
was a French armed brig, the Ottawa, with ten cannon and a hundred
men, threatening destruction to Amherst's bateaux and whaleboats.
Five gunboats attacked and captured her. Then the army advanced again
and were presently joined by two armed vessels of their own which had
lingered behind, bewildered among the channels of the Thousand Islands.

"Near the head of the rapids, a little below La Galette, stood Fort
Lévis, built the year before on an islet in midchannel. Amherst might
have passed its batteries with slight loss, continuing his voyage
without paying it the honour of a siege; and this is what the French
commanders feared that he would do. 'We shall be fortunate,' Lévis
wrote to Bourlamaque, 'if the enemy amuse themselves with capturing it.
My chief anxiety is, lest Amherst should reach Montreal so soon, that
we may not have time to unite our forces to attack Haviland or Murray.'
If he had better known the English commander, Lévis would have seen
that he was not the man to leave a post of the enemy in his rear under
any circumstances; and Amherst had also another reason for wishing to
get the garrison into his hands, for he expected to find among them the
pilots whom he needed to guide his boats down the rapids. He therefore
invested the fort, and on the 23d cannonaded it from his vessels, the
mainland and the neighbouring islands. It was commanded by Pouchot,
the late commandant of Niagara, made prisoner in the last campaign and
since exchanged. As the rocky islet had but little earth, the defences,
though thick and strong, were chiefly of logs, which flew in splinters
under the bombardment. The French, however, made a brave resistance.
The firing lasted all day, was resumed in the morning, and continued
two days more, when Pouchot, whose works were in ruins, surrendered
himself and his garrison. On this Johnson's Indians prepared to kill
the prisoners, and being compelled to desist, three-fourths of them
went home in a rage.[219]

"Now began the critical part of the expedition, the descent of the
rapids. The Galops, the Rapide Plat, the Long Sault, the Côteau du Lac,
were passed in succession, with little loss, till they reached the
Cedars, the Buisson and the Cascades, where the reckless surges dashed
and pounded in the sun, beautiful and terrible as young tigers at play.
Boat after boat, borne on their foaming crests, rushed hard by down the
torrent. Forty-six were totally wrecked, eighteen were damaged, and
eighty-four men were drowned. Luc La Corne was watching the rapids with
a considerable body of Canadians, and it is difficult to see why this
bold and enterprising chief allowed the army to descend undisturbed
through passes so dangerous. At length the last rapid was left behind,
and the flotilla, gliding in peace over the smooth breast of Lake St.
Louis, landed at Isle Perrot, a few leagues from Montreal. In the
morning, September 6th, the troops embarked again, landing unopposed
at Lachine, nine miles from the city, marched down without delay and
encamped before its walls.[220]

"The Montreal of that time was a long, narrow assemblage of wooden or
stone houses, one or two stories high, above which rose the peaked
towers of the seminary, the spires of three churches, the walls of four
convents, with the trees of their adjacent gardens; and, conspicuous at
the lower end, a high mound of earth crowned by a redoubt, where a few
cannon were mounted. The whole was surrounded by a shallow moat and a
bastioned stone wall, made for defence against Indians and incapable of
resisting cannon."[221]

An idea of Montreal on this evening may now be conceived. Within
forty-eight hours the three English armies, with wonderful precision
and generalship, had united and invested the city--Amherst in the
Northwest, Haviland at Longeuil on the south shore, and Murray also at
a distance of a four hours' march.

Within the island the forces of Bourlamaque, Bougainville and
Roquemaure, abandoned by the militia, had gathered from the south shore
over the river. The corps of Bourlamaque was placed below the city;
that of Roquemaure was stationed above; Dumas was posted on the eastern
part of the island; Bougainville apparently remained in the town.

"The town," says Parkman, "was crowded with noncombatant refugees.
Here, too, was nearly all the remaining force of Canada, consisting
of twenty-two hundred troops of the line and some two hundred colony
troops; for all the Canadians had by this time gone home. Many of the
regulars, especially of the colony troops, had also deserted; and the
rest were so broken in discipline that their officers were forced to
use entreaties instead of commands. The three armies encamped around
the city amounted to seventeen thousand men."[222]

On the night of the 6th a council of the officers was held by Vaudreuil
in his château, when a memoir proposing a capitulation was read by
Bigot. It set forth that by the desertion of the Canadians and of a
great number of the soldiers, the whole force available was 2,400 men.
The Indians had made peace with the English and had even offered to aid
in conquering the French. It was to be expected, that on the morning,
Murray would land on the island of Montreal, and a corps on the
southern bank of the river would join the main army; and that it was
for the benefit of the colony to obtain an advantageous capitulation.
The conclusion was accepted by all present.

At 7 o'clock on the morning of the 7th, de Bougainville was sent
with a proposal to Amherst for a cessation of arms for a month. It
was refused, and after some conversation, Amherst consented that no
movement should be made until 12 o'clock. Vaudreuil, however, at 10
o'clock sent a messenger to Amherst. On this occasion he offered to
capitulate and he enclosed the terms on which he proposed to surrender.

These contained fifty-five articles of capitulation. Amherst granted
the greater part, modified others and some he flatly refused. Among
these latter was a clause that the French troops should march out of
the city with arms, cannon and the honours of war. The answer was: "The
whole garrison of Montreal, and all of the French troops in Canada,
must lay down their arms and shall not serve during the present war."[223]

This hurt the pride of General de Lévis. At this request "Vaudreuil
sent back du Lac with a letter asking a reconsideration of the
terms."[224] Amherst replied that he had set forth the terms he had
determined to grant, and he desired an immediate reply to their
acceptance, for the conditions would not be changed. Again de
Vaudreuil sent de Bougainville with a request that he would hear his
explanation. Amherst gave the same answer, that he could make no change
in the conditions; and he desired an immediate reply to know if they
were accepted or not. The conditions, however, were not concluded, for
de Lévis sent de la Pause, his quartermaster general, to treat with
Amherst on the subject of the too rigorous article imposed upon the
troops, which he said they could not accept, and he asked Amherst to
consider its hardship. Amherst briefly repeated the substance of his
former letters and demanded a definite answer by the bearer.[225]

These denials so piqued de Lévis that he threatened to return to St.
Helen's Island and defend it to the last extremity; but Vaudreuil
ordered him to disarm. Vaudreuil was wise, but no doubt de Lévis'
design was to show France that its heroes were staunch to the end and
ready literally to preserve some territory, small as it might be, for
the _fleur-de-lys_ to wave over in defiance. That night the English
slept on their arms again. It was not until the 8th that de Vaudreuil
sent his unconditional acceptance of the articles, which were signed on
the same day by himself and Jeffrey Amherst.[226]

Amherst, in his despatch to Pitt, tells the circumstances of the actual
signature: "The troops passed the night (the 7th) under arms, and early
in the morning I received a letter from the Marquis de Vaudreuil to
which I replied; then I sent Major Abercromby to the town to bring
back the articles of capitulation signed by the Marquis de Vaudreuil.
I had then forwarded to the latter a duplicate bearing my signature.
Then Colonel Haldimand, with the grenadiers and the light infantry,
took possession of the fort and tomorrow he will put into execution
the articles of capitulation."--"Archives Canadiennes," Doc. Const.
(translated from French version).

[Illustration: About 1760

THE YEAR OF CAPITULATION

Published by Jefferys, the corner of St. Martin's Lane in the Strand]

The articles of capitulation were written in French, no signed copy
in English being extant. The terms are those of the surrender of a
conquered people, though the spirit of generosity marks them, on the
part of the conquerors.

As had been said the troops were to lay down their arms, were not to
serve again during the war and were to be sent back to France, to the
first port, by the shortest route. Protection to deserters on both
sides was refused; the sick and wounded were to be treated kindly.
The demand that the Indians under British arms should be sent away
after the signing of the articles was refused on the ground "that
there had never been any cruelties practiced by the savages of our
army." The demand for protection against disorders on the part of the
victorious troops was answered by Amherst laconically: "Good order will
be maintained." M. de Vaudreuil, M. de Rigaud, governor of Montreal,
and their officers and suites shall be treated with consideration,
maintained in the houses till their embarkation. They could carry away
their private papers, except those archives that may be necessary
for the good government of the country. It was asked that if peace
were proclaimed, matters should return to the previous state and the
capitulation should be null and void. Amherst answered that the orders
of the king on this point would be obeyed. Full facilities were given
for the free transportation of officers of state, of justice, of
police, etc., and for the soldiers and their wives; a hospital ship for
the sick and wounded was to be provided.

All who had business in the country could remain with the permission of
M. de Vaudreuil until they had arranged their affairs.

The chief of the commissary department or his representative should be
allowed to remain in the country till the following year to satisfy
the debts contracted in the colony. The "Company of the Indies" shall
maintain the possession of its peltry, but if it is found that His
Very Christian Majesty has any share in it, that would be transferred
to the benefit of the English king. All in general engaged in trade
or possessing property shall be allowed to go to France with their
families, etc., but they shall pay for the freightage of their
merchandise and furniture, etc.

There was no mention of the use of the French language made on either
side. The free exercise of the "Roman Catholic and Apostolic religion"
was accorded, the obligation of paying the "dime" to the clergy being
reserved to the good will of the king.

The ordinary ecclesiastical functions were to be continued, but the
demand that the king of France should continue to name the bishop of
the colony, who should always be a Roman Catholic, was refused. As Mgr.
de Pontbriand was but lately dead,[227] and as his successor was not yet
appointed, this seemed an opportunity for the English, if desired, to
control future episcopal elections. In the meantime the power to create
new parishes was refused.

The nuns were maintained in their constitutions and privileges; the
same considerations for the Jesuits, Recollects and Sulpicians were
refused "until the king's pleasure be known." All these communities,
however, should be allowed to retain their property with the right of
disposing of their possessions and withdrawing with the money to France.

In answer to the condition asked for by de Vaudreuil, that those who
remained is the colony should not be liable to bear arms, directly or
indirectly, against the king of France or his allies, but should be
allowed to observe a strict neutrality, Amherst answered laconically
but significantly, "_they become the subjects of the king_."

Article 42 demanded that the French Canadians shall continue to be
governed according to the "coutume de Paris" and the laws and usages
established for this country; and they shall not be liable to be
subjected to any other taxes than those which were established under
the French domination. This is again met by a similar reply as above.

The remaining articles were such as would safeguard the people and
would provide for the ordinary rights of seigneurial tenure, of real
property, of commerce, of negro and Indian slaves and the exercise of
justice. The whole was fairminded, being the offer of the conquered
party, almost entirely accepted, with the distinctions recorded above.

By the signatures of Vaudreuil and Amherst, half a continent had been
ceded to British arms. The newspapers of the British-American colonies,
at the news of the fall of Montreal, recount joyful celebrations. The
pulpits of New England spoke in exultant tones, but not of ill will
against the conquered race. Their manuscripts are still extant.[228]
Thomas Foxcroft, pastor of the Old Church in Boston, proclaimed: "Long
had it been the common opinion, 'Delenda est Carthago,' Canada must be
conquered, as we could hope for no lasting peace in these parts and
now, through the good hand of our God upon us, we see the happy day of
its accomplishment."

The British progressivism of some of the pulpit utterances is
interesting. Eli Forbes, speaking of Amherst, says: "The renowned
general, worthy of that most honourable of all titles, the Christian
hero; for he loves his enemies and while he subdues them he makes them
happy. He transplants British liberty to where till now it was unknown.
He acts the general, the Briton, the conqueror, and the Christian. What
fair hopes arise from the peaceful and undisturbed enjoyment of this
good land, and the blessing of our gracious God with it! Methinks, I
see towns enlarged, settlements increased and this howling wilderness
becomes a fruitful field which the Lord hath blessed; and to complete
the scene, I see churches rise and flourish in every Christian grace
where has been the seat of Satan and Indian idolatry."

A sentiment thoroughly admirable, but somewhat faulty in the want
of recognition of the heroic missionary work already done for the
Christian cause.

On the morning, following the signing of the capitulation, September
9th, the "Place d'Armes" was the rendezvous of a detachment of troops
and artillery, who thus formally took possession of the town.[229]
Thither the French regiments repaired, and one after another laid down
their arms, returning to their own camp on the ramparts. After this
act of submission, the British took possession of the gates and placed
guards in the town.

On Citadel Hill, to the east of the town, the British flag supplanted
the _fleur-de-lys_ of France.

Thus ended Montreal under the French régime.


FOOTNOTES:

[218] "Montcalm and Wolfe," Vol. II.

[219] Sir William Johnson informed Amherst that he was apprehensive
the Indians would leave the army. Amherst replied "that he believed
his army was fully sufficient the service he was going upon, without
their assistance; that although he wished to preserve their friendship,
he could not prevail on himself to purchase it at the expense of
countenancing the horrid barbarities they wanted to perpetrate;" and he
added "that if they quitted the army and committed any acts of cruelty,
he would on his return assuredly chastise them." Upon this the whole
retired with the exception of 170, who were afterwards distinguished
upon their arrival in Montreal by the gift of a medal from the general,
that they might be known at the English posts and receive the civil
treatment their conduct deserved.--Maubé, p. 306.

Mr. G. E. Hart, in "The Fall of New France," says this medal is well
known to numismatists. The obverse has a view of Montreal; the reverse
plain, with the name and tribe of the Indians engraved. As it was given
before the general's departure, and is very archaic, it must have been
made at Montreal at the time.

[220] "The landing was made at Lachine. Two New York and two
Connecticut regiments were left to hold the place and guard the boats,
while the main force proceeded to the open ground, traversed by the
River St. Pierre, which then existed to the west of Montreal, through
which the Grand Trunk now runs on leaving the city. There the British
troops established themselves, the men, on the night of the 6th of
September, lying on their arms."--Kingsford, "History of Canada," Vol.
IV, p. 393.

[221] "I locate his (Amherst's) position about the foot of Côte
des Neiges, between Guy Street and Clarke Avenue on the one side;
Sherbrooke Street and Dorchester Street on the other. The house in
which the capitulation was signed existed until quite recently, and
was at the head of the hill, near the site of the Côte des Neiges' old
tollgate."--G. E. Hart, "The Fall of New France," note on p. 143. There
are several other houses claiming to be capitulation house.--Ed.

and raises the number to 32,000 in a letter to the minister next day.
Burrows says 20,000; Lévis, for obvious reasons, exaggerates the number
to 40,000." Parkman, "Montcalm and Wolfe," Vol. II, p. 372.

[225] Knox gives an account of this interview which is not
authenticated by other evidence. It must, however, be borne in mind
that Knox was present with the troops, and that he was generally
well informed of what took place. His work was published within a
few years after 1760, and there is every reason to believe it was
seen by Amherst. "When," says Knox, "the bearer of this billet saw
that the general had perused its contents he attempted to support
the Chevalier's complaint respecting the article alluded to; but His
Excellency commanded him to silence and told him he was fully resolved,
for the infamous part the troops of France had acted in exciting the
savages to perpetrate the most horrid and unheard of barbarities in the
whole progress of war, and for open treacheries as well as flagrant
breaches of faith, to manifest to all the world by this capitulation
his detestation of such ungenerous practices, and disapprobation of
their conduct; he therefore insisted he might decline any remonstrance
on the subject."--Knox, II, p. 418.

[227] M. de Pontbriand died at the seminary on June 8, 1760. The loss
of their bishop was looked upon as a veritable disaster. In the funeral
oration of June 25th the curé d'office, M. Jolivet, did not dissimulate
the fear of all that the Catholic religion was now to be extinguished.
But the conquerors were far more merciful than was expected.

APPENDIX II

AN INVENTORY OF THE CHARTS AND PLANS OF THE ISLAND AND TOWN OF MONTREAL
UP TO 1760


By the kindness of the archivist of the district of Montreal, Mr.
E. Z. Massicotte, we include the following list of plans, etc., of
Montreal, up to 1760. It is not offered as a complete list. Such would
necessitate a voluminous book. It is, however, a very representative
one, and a contribution to history and archaeology. The compiler has
consulted the following works: Dionne, "Inventaire Chronologique,"
Volume IV; Holmden, "Catalogue des Cartes et plans des Archives
Fedérales;" Gagnon, "Essai de Bibliographie;" in addition he has noted
the collections in the City Hall, the Château de Ramezay, the Court
House, of Montreal, and finally those in his own collection.[238]
